  A
  
   music video
  
  is a
  
   short film
  
  integrating a
  
   song
  
  and imagery, produced for
  
   promotional
  
  or
  
   artistic
  
  purposes.
  

    [1]
   

  Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a
  
   marketing
  
  device intended to promote the sale of
  
   music recordings
  
  . There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to
  
   musical short films
  
  that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when
  
   MTV
  
  based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including "
  
   illustrated song
  
  ", "filmed insert", "promotional (promo) film", "promotional clip", "promotional video", "song video", "song clip" or "film clip".
 
  Music videos use a wide range of styles of contemporary videomaking techniques, including
  
   animation
  
  ,
  
   live action
  
  filming,
  
   documentaries
  
  , and non-narrative approaches such as
  
   abstract film
  
  . Some music videos blend different styles, such as animation, music, and live action. Combining these styles and techniques has become more popular because of the variation it presents to the audience. Many music videos interpret images and scenes from the song's lyrics, while others take a more thematic approach. Other music videos may be without a set concept, being merely a filmed version of the song's live performance.
  

    [2]
   


   Product placement
  
  is a common technique in music videos, exemplified by the appearance of the
  
   Beats Pill
  
  in numerous hip hop videos.
 


  In 1894,
  
   sheet music
  
  publishers Edward B. Marks and Joe Stern hired electrician George Thomas and various performers to promote sales of their song "
  
   The Little Lost Child
  
  ".
  

    [3]
   

  Using a
  
   magic lantern
  
  , Thomas projected a series of still images on a screen simultaneous to live performances. This would become a popular form of entertainment known as the
  
   illustrated song
  
  , the first step toward music video.
  

    [3]
   


  In 1926, with the arrival of "
  
   talkies
  
  " many
  
   musical short films
  
  were produced.
  
   Vitaphone
  
  shorts (produced by
  
   Warner Bros.
  
  ) featured many bands, vocalists and dancers. Animation artist
  
   Max Fleischer
  
  introduced a series of sing-along short cartoons called
  

    Screen Songs
   

  , which invited audiences to sing along to popular songs by "following the bouncing ball", which is similar to a modern karaoke machine. Early 1930s cartoons featured popular musicians performing their hit songs on-camera in live-action segments during the
  
   cartoons
  
  . The early animated films by
  
   Walt Disney
  
  , such as the
  

    Silly Symphonies
   

  shorts and especially
  

    Fantasia
   

  , which featured several interpretations of classical pieces, were built around music. The
  
   Warner Brothers
  
  cartoons, even today billed as
  

    Looney Tunes
   

  and
  

    Merrie Melodies
   

  , were initially fashioned around specific songs from upcoming Warner Brothers
  
   musical films
  
  . Live action musical shorts, featuring such popular performers as
  
   Cab Calloway
  
  , were also distributed to theaters.
 

   Blues
  
  singer
  
   Bessie Smith
  
  appeared in a two-reel short film called
  

    St. Louis Blues
   

  (1929) featuring a dramatized performance of the hit song. Numerous other musicians appeared in short musical subjects during this period.
 

   Soundies
  
  , produced and released from 1940 to 1947, were musical films that often included short dance sequences, similar to later music videos.
 
  In the mid-1940s, musician
  
   Louis Jordan
  
  made short films for his songs, some of which were spliced together into a feature film
  

    Lookout Sister
   

  . These films were, according to music historian Donald Clarke, the "ancestors" of music video.
  

    [4]
   



   Musical films
  
  were another important precursor to music video, and several well-known music videos have imitated the style of classic Hollywood musicals from the 1930s to the 1950s. One of the best-known examples is Madonna's 1985 video for "
  
   Material Girl
  
  " (directed by
  
   Mary Lambert
  
  )
  

    [5]
   

  which was closely modelled on
  
   Jack Cole
  
  's staging of "
  
   Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
  
  " from the film
  

    Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
   

  . Several of
  
   Michael Jackson
  
  's videos show the unmistakable influence of the dance sequences in classic Hollywood musicals, including the landmark "
  
   Thriller
  
  " and the
  
   Martin Scorsese
  
  -directed "
  
   Bad
  
  " which was influenced by the stylised dance "fights" in the film version of
  

    West Side Story
   

  .
  

    [6]
   

  According to the
  
   Internet Accuracy Project
  
  ,
  
   disc jockey
  
  –singer J. P. "
  
   The Big Bopper
  
  " Richardson was the first to coin the phrase "music video", in 1959.
  

    [7]
   


  In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the
  
   Serpentine
  
  in
  
   Hyde Park
  
  , London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "
  
   Stranger in Paradise
  
  ".
  

    [8]
   

  The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including
  
   Dick Clark
  
  's
  
   American Bandstand
  
  .
  

    [9]
   


  The oldest example of a promotional music video with similarities to more abstract, modern videos seems to be "Dáme si do bytu" ("Let's get to the apartment") created in 1958 and directed by
  
   Ladislav Rychman
  
  .
  

    [10]
   



    [11]
   


  In the late 1950s
  

    [12]
   

  the
  
   Scopitone
  
  , a visual jukebox, was invented in France and short films were produced by many French artists, such as
  
   Serge Gainsbourg
  
  ,
  
   Françoise Hardy
  
  ,
  
   Jacques Dutronc
  
  , and the Belgian
  
   Jacques Brel
  
  to accompany their songs. Its use spread to other countries and similar machines such as the Cinebox in Italy and Color-Sonic in the USA were patented.
  

    [12]
   

  In 1961, for the Canadian show
  

    Singalong Jubilee
   

  ,
  
   Manny Pittson
  
  began pre-recording the music audio, went on-location and taped various visuals with the musicians lip-synching, then edited the audio and video together. Most music numbers were taped in-studio on stage, and the location shoot "videos" were to add variety.
  

    [13]
   

  In 1964,
  
   Kenneth Anger
  
  's
  
   experimental
  
  short film,
  

    Scorpio Rising
   

  used popular songs instead of dialog.
 
  In 1964,
  
   The Moody Blues
  
  producer,
  
   Alex Murray
  
  , wanted to promote his version of "
  
   Go Now
  
  ". The short film clip he produced and directed to promote the single has a striking visual style that predates
  
   Queen's
  
  similar "
  
   Bohemian Rhapsody
  
  " video by a full decade. It also predates what
  
   The Beatles
  
  did with promotional films of their singles "
  
   Rain
  
  " and "
  
   Paperback Writer
  
  ", both released in 1966.
 
  In the same year, The Beatles starred in their first feature film
  

    A Hard Day's Night
   

  , directed by
  
   Richard Lester
  
  . Shot in
  
   black-and-white
  
  and presented as a
  
   mock documentary
  
  , it interspersed comedic and dialogue sequences with musical tones. The musical sequences furnished basic templates on which countless subsequent music videos were modeled. It was the direct model for the successful US TV series
  

    The Monkees
   

  (1966–1968), which similarly consisted of film segments that were created to accompany various Monkees songs.
  

    [14]
   

  The Beatles' second feature
  

    Help!
   

  (1965) was a much more lavish affair, filmed in colour in London and on international locations. The title track sequence, filmed in black-and-white, is arguably one of the prime archetypes of the modern performance-style music video, employing rhythmic cross-cutting, contrasting long shots and close-ups, and unusual shots and camera angles, such as the shot 50 seconds into the song, in which George Harrison's left hand and the neck of his guitar are seen in sharp focus in the foreground while the completely out-of-focus figure of John Lennon sings in the background.
 
  In 1965, the Beatles began making promotional clips (then known as "filmed inserts") for distribution and broadcast in other countries—primarily the USA—so they could promote their record releases without having to make in-person appearances. Their first batch of promo videos recorded in late 1965 (including their then-current single, "
  
   Day Tripper
  
  "/"
  
   We Can Work It Out
  
  "), were fairly straightforward mimed-in-studio performance pieces (albeit sometimes in silly sets) and meant to blend in fairly seamlessly with television shows like
  

    Top of the Pops
   

  and
  

    Hullabaloo
   

  . By the time The Beatles stopped touring in late 1966, their promotional films, like their recordings, had become highly sophisticated. In May 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single "
  
   Rain
  
  "/"
  
   Paperback Writer
  
  " all directed by
  
   Michael Lindsay-Hogg
  
  ,
  

    [15]
   

  who went on to direct
  

    The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus
   

  and The Beatles final film
  

    Let It Be
   

  . The colour promotional clips for "
  
   Strawberry Fields Forever
  
  " and "
  
   Penny Lane
  
  ", made in early 1967 and directed by
  
   Peter Goldman
  


    [16]
   

  took the promotional film format to a new level. They used techniques borrowed from underground and avant garde film, including reversed film and slow motion, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles and color filtering added in post-production. At the end of 1967 the group released their third film, the one hour, made-for-television project
  

    Magical Mystery Tour
   

  ; it was written and directed by the group and first broadcast on the
  
   BBC
  
  on
  
   Boxing Day
  
  1967. Although poorly received at the time for lacking a narrative structure, it showed the group to be accomplished music video makers in their own right.
 

   Concert films
  
  were being released in the mid-1960s, at least as early as 1964, with the
  
   T.A.M.I. Show
  
  .
 
  The monochrome 1966 clip for
  
   Bob Dylan
  
  's "
  
   Subterranean Homesick Blues
  
  " filmed by
  
   D. A. Pennebaker
  
  was featured in Pennebaker's Dylan film documentary
  

    Dont Look Back
   

  . Eschewing any attempt to simulate performance or present a narrative, the clip shows Dylan standing in a city back alley, silently shuffling a series of large cue cards (bearing key words from the song's lyrics). Many "filmed inserts" were produced by UK artists so they could be screened on TV when the bands were not available to appear live.
  
   Pink Floyd
  
  were pioneers in producing promotional films for their songs including "
  
   San Francisco: Film
  
  ", directed by
  
   Anthony Stern
  
  , "
  
   Scarecrow
  
  ", "
  
   Arnold Layne
  
  " and "
  
   Interstellar Overdrive
  
  ", the latter directed by
  
   Peter Whitehead
  
  , who also made several pioneering clips for
  
   The Rolling Stones
  
  between 1966 and 1968. In the UK
  
   The Kinks
  
  made one of the first "
  
   plot
  
  " promo clips for a song. For their single "
  
   Dead End Street
  
  " (1966) a miniature comic movie was made. The BBC reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in "poor taste".
  

    [17]
   


   The Who
  
  featured in several promotional clips in this period, beginning with their 1965 clip for
  

    I Can't Explain
   

  . Their plot clip for
  

    Happy Jack
   

  (1966) shows the band acting like a gang of thieves. The promo film to
  
   Call Me Lightning
  
  (1968) tells a story of how drummer
  
   Keith Moon
  
  came to join the group: The other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a "bleeding box" arrives, out of which jumps a fast-running, time lapse, Moon that the other members subsequently try to get a hold of in a sped-up slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down. In 1966,
  
   Nancy Sinatra
  
  filmed a music video for her song
  
   These Boots Are Made for Walkin'
  
  .
 
  The Rolling Stones appeared in many promotional clips for their songs in the 1960s. In 1966,
  
   Peter Whitehead
  
  directed two promo clips for their single "
  
   Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow?
  
  "
  

    [18]
   

  In 1967, Whitehead directed a plot clip colour promo clip for the Stones single "
  
   We Love You
  
  ", which first aired in August 1967.
  

    [19]
   

  This clip featured sped-up footage of the group recording in the studio, intercut with a mock trial that clearly alludes to the drug prosecutions of
  
   Mick Jagger
  
  and
  
   Keith Richards
  
  underway at that time. Jagger's girlfriend
  
   Marianne Faithfull
  
  appears in the trial scenes and presents the "judge" (Richards) with what may be the infamous fur rug that had featured so prominently in the press reports of the drug bust at Richards' house in early 1967. When it is pulled back, it reveals an apparently naked Jagger with chains around his ankles. The clip concludes with scenes of the Stones in the studio intercut with footage that had previously been used in the "concert version" promo clip for "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby". The group also filmed a colour promo clip for the song "2000 Light Years From Home" (from their album
  

    Their Satanic Majesties Request
   

  ) directed by
  
   Michael Lindsay-Hogg
  
  .
  

    [18]
   

  In 1968,
  
   Michael Lindsay-Hogg
  
  directed three clips for their single "Jumping Jack Flash" / "Child Of The Moon"—a colour clip for "Child Of The Moon" and two different clips for "
  
   Jumpin' Jack Flash
  
  ". In 1968, they collaborated with
  
   Jean-Luc Godard
  
  on the film
  

    Sympathy for the Devil
   

  , which mixed Godard's politics with documentary footage of the song's evolution during recording sessions.
 
  During late 1972–73
  
   David Bowie
  
  featured in a series of promotional films directed by pop photographer
  
   Mick Rock
  
  , who worked extensively with Bowie in this period. Rock directed and edited four clips to promote four consecutive David Bowie singles—"
  
   John, I'm Only Dancing
  
  " (May 1972), "
  
   The Jean Genie
  
  " (Nov. 1972), the December 1972 US re-release of "
  
   Space Oddity
  
  " and the 1973 release of the single "
  
   Life on Mars?
  
  " (lifted from Bowie's earlier album
  

    Hunky Dory
   

  ). The clip for "John, I'm Only Dancing" was made with a budget of just
  
   US$
  
  200 and filmed at the afternoon rehearsal for Bowie's
  
   Rainbow Theatre
  
  concert on August 19, 1972. It shows Bowie and band miming to the record intercut with footage of Bowie's dancers
  
   The Astronettes
  
  dancing on stage and behind a back-lit screen. The clip was turned down by the BBC, who reportedly found the homosexual overtones of the film distasteful, although
  
   Top of the Pops
  
  replaced it with footage of bikers and a dancer.
  

    [20]
   

  The "Jean Genie" clip, produced for just US$350, was shot in one day and edited in less than two days. It intercuts footage of Bowie and band in concert with contrasting footage of the group in a photographic studio, wearing black stage outfits and standing against a white background. It also includes location footage with Bowie and
  
   Cyrinda Foxe
  
  (a MainMan employee and a friend of David and
  
   Angie Bowie
  
  ) shot in San Francisco outside the famous
  
   Mars Hotel
  
  , with Fox posing provocatively in the street while Bowie lounges against the wall, smoking.
  

    [21]
   


  Country music also picked up on the trend of promotional clips to go along with songs. Sam Lovullo, the producer of the television series
  

    Hee Haw
   

  , said his show presented "what were, in reality, the first musical videos,"
  

    [22]
   

  while JMI Records made the same claim with
  
   Don Williams
  
  ' 1973 song, "The Shelter of Your Eyes."
  

    [23]
   

  Country music historian Bob Millard wrote that JMI had pioneered the country music video concept by "producing a 3-minute film" to go along with Williams' song.
  

    [23]
   

  Lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the show's staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers, before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song. "The video material was a very workable production item for the show," he wrote. "It provided picture stories for songs. However, some of our guests felt the videos took attention away from their live performances, which they hoped would promote record sales. If they had a hit song, they didn't want to play it under comic barnyard footage." The concept's mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the "video" concept on
  
   Hee Haw
  
  .
  

    [22]
   

  Promotional videos of country music songs, however, continued to be produced.
 
  The Australian TV shows
  

    Countdown
   

  and
  

    Sounds
   

  , both of which premiered in 1974, were significant in developing and popularizing the music video genre in Australia and other countries, and in establishing the importance of music video clips as a means of promoting both emerging acts and new releases by established acts. In early 1974, former radio DJ
  
   Graham Webb
  
  launched a weekly teen-oriented TV music show which screened on
  
   Sydney
  
  's
  
   ATN-7
  
  on Saturday mornings; this was renamed
  
   Sounds Unlimited
  
  in 1975 and later shortened simply to
  
   Sounds
  
  . In need of material for the show, Webb approached Seven newsroom staffer
  
   Russell Mulcahy
  
  and asked him to shoot film footage to accompany popular songs for which there were no purpose-made clips (e.g.
  
   Harry Nilsson
  
  's "
  
   Everybody's Talkin
  
  "). Using this method, Webb and Mulcahy assembled a collection of about 25 clips for the show. The success of his early efforts encouraged Mulcahy to quit his TV job and become a full-time director, and he made clips for several popular Australian acts including
  
   Stylus
  
  ,
  
   Marcia Hines
  
  ,
  
   Hush
  
  and
  
   AC/DC
  
  .
  

    [24]
   

  As it gained popularity,
  
   Countdown
  
  talent coordinator
  
   Ian "Molly" Meldrum
  
  and producer Michael Shrimpton quickly realized that "film clips" were becoming an important new commodity in music marketing. Despite the show's minuscule budget,
  
   Countdown'
  
  s original director
  
   Paul Drane
  
  was able to create several memorable music videos especially for the show, including the classic film-clips for the AC/DC hits "
  
   It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)
  
  " and "
  
   Jailbreak
  
  ".
  

    [24]
   

  After relocating to the UK in the mid-1970s, Mulcahy made successful music videos for several noted British pop acts—his early UK credits included
  
   XTC
  
  's "Making Plans for Nigel" (1979) and his landmark video for
  
   The Buggles
  
  ' "
  
   Video Killed the Radio Star
  
  " (1979) which became the first music video played on
  
   MTV
  
  in 1981.
  

    [25]
   


  In 1975, the British rock band
  
   Queen
  
  employed
  
   Bruce Gowers
  
  to make a promotional video to show their new single "
  
   Bohemian Rhapsody
  
  " on the BBC music series
  

    Top of the Pops
   

  . According to rock historian Paul Fowles, the song is "widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy".
  

    [26]
   



    Rolling Stone
   

  has said of "Bohemian Rhapsody": "Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air."
  

    [27]
   




    Video Concert Hall
   

  , created by Jerry Crowe and
  
   Charles Henderson
  
  , launched on November 1, 1979, was the first nationwide video music programming on American television, predating MTV by almost three years.

    [30]
   



    [31]
   

  The
  
   USA Cable Network
  
  program
  

    Night Flight
   

  was one of the first American programs to showcase these videos as an artform.
 
  In 1980, the music video to
  
   David Bowie's
  
  "
  
   Ashes to Ashes
  
  " became the
  
   most expensive ever made
  
  , having a production cost of $582,000 ($1,671,487 in 2016), the first music video to have a production cost of over $500,000.
  

    [32]
   

  The video was made in
  
   solarised
  
  color with stark black-and-white scenes and was filmed in multiple locations, including a padded room and a rocky shore.
  

    [33]
   

  The video became one of the most iconic ever made at the time, and its complex nature is seen as significant in the evolution of the music video.
 
  The same year, the New Zealand group
  
   Split Enz
  
  had major success with the single "I Got You" and the album
  

    True Colours
   

  , and later that year they produced a complete set of promo clips for each song on the album (directed by their percussionist,
  
   Noel Crombie
  
  ) and to market these on video cassette. This was followed a year later by the first American video album,
  

    The Completion Backward Principle
   

  by
  
   The Tubes
  
  , directed by the group's keyboard player
  
   Michael Cotten
  
  , which included two videos directed by Russell Mulcahy ("Talk to Ya Later" and "Don't Want to Wait Anymore").
  

    [34]
   

  Among the first music videos were clips produced by
  
   ex-Monkee
  

   Michael Nesmith
  
  who started making short musical films for
  

    Saturday Night Live
   

  .
  

    [14]
   

  In 1981, he released
  

    Elephant Parts

   Grammy
  
  for music video, directed by William Dear.
  

    Billboard

  the independently produced
  
   Video Concert Hall
  
  as being the first with nationwide video music programming on American television.

    [31]
   


  In 1981, the
  
   U.S.
  
  video channel
  
   MTV
  
  launched, airing "
  
   Video Killed the Radio Star
  
  " and beginning an era of 24-hour-a-day music on television. With this new outlet for material, the music video would, by the mid-1980s, grow to play a central role in popular music marketing. Many important acts of this period, most notably
  
   Adam and the Ants
  
  ,
  
   Duran Duran
  
  and
  
   Madonna
  
  , owed a great deal of their success to the skillful construction and seductive appeal of their videos.
 
  Two key innovations in the development of the modern music video were the development of relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use
  
   video
  
  recording and editing equipment, and the development of visual effects created with techniques such as image
  
   compositing
  
  .

  enabling many pop acts to produce promotional videos quickly and cheaply, in comparison to the relatively high costs of using film. However, as the genre developed,
  
   music video directors
  
  increasingly turned to 35 mm film as the preferred medium, while others mixed film and video. During the 1980s, music videos had become
  
   de rigueur
  
  for most recording artists. The phenomenon was famously parodied by
  
   BBC
  
  television comedy program
  

    Not The Nine O'Clock News
   

  who produced a spoof music video "Nice Video, Shame About The Song".
 
  In this period, directors and the acts they worked with began to explore and expand the form and style of the genre, using more sophisticated effects in their videos, mixing film and video, and adding a storyline or plot to the music video. Occasionally videos were made in a
  
   non-representational
  
  form, in which the musical artist was not shown. Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist, such videos are comparatively rare; three early 1980s examples are
  
   Bruce Springsteen
  
  's "
  
   Atlantic City
  
  ", directed by
  
   Arnold Levine
  
  ,
  
   David Mallet
  
  's video for
  
   David Bowie
  
  and
  
   Queen
  
  's "
  
   Under Pressure
  
  ", and
  
   Ian Emes
  
  ' video for
  
   Duran Duran
  
  's "
  
   The Chauffeur
  
  ". One notable later example of the non-representational style is
  
   Bill Konersman
  
  's innovative 1987 video for
  
   Prince
  
  's "
  
   Sign o' the Times
  
  "
  

    [35]
   

  – influenced by Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" clip, it featured only the text of the song's lyrics.
 
  In the early 1980s, music videos also began to explore political and social themes. Examples include the music videos for
  
   David Bowie's
  
  "
  
   China Girl
  
  " and "
  
   Let's Dance
  
  " (1983) which both explored race issues.
  

    [36]
   

  In an 1983 interview, Bowie spoke about the importance of using music videos in addressing social issues, "Let's try to use the video format as a platform for some kind of social observation, and not just waste it on trotting out and trying to enhance the public image of the singer involved".
  

    [37]
   


  In 1983, the most successful, influential and iconic music video of all time was released: the nearly 14-minute-long video for
  
   Michael Jackson
  
  's song "
  
   Thriller
  
  ", directed by
  
   John Landis
  
  . The video set new standards for production, having cost US$800,000 to film.
  

    [38]
   



    [39]
   

  The video for "Thriller", along with earlier videos by Jackson for his songs "
  
   Billie Jean
  
  " and "
  
   Beat It
  
  ", were instrumental in getting music videos by
  
   African American
  
  artists played on MTV. Prior to Jackson's success, videos by African-American artists were rarely played on MTV: according to MTV, this was because it initially conceived itself as a rock-music-oriented channel, although musician
  
   Rick James
  
  was outspoken in his criticism of the cable channel, claiming in 1983 that MTV's refusal to air the music video for his song "
  
   Super Freak
  
  " and clips by other African-American performers was "blatant racism".

  On March 5, 1983,
  
   Country Music Television
  
  , or CMT, was launched,
  

    [41]
   

  created and founded by Glenn D. Daniels and uplinked from the Video World Productions facility in
  
   Hendersonville, Tennessee
  
  . The
  
   MuchMusic
  
  music channel was launched in
  
   Canada
  
  in 1984. In 1984, MTV also launched the
  
   MTV Video Music Awards
  
  (later to be known as the VMA's), an annual awards event that would come to underscore MTV's importance in the music industry. The inaugural event rewarded
  
   The Beatles
  
  and
  
   David Bowie
  
  with the '
  
   Video Vanguard Award
  
  ' for their work in pioneering the music video.
 
  In 1985, MTV launched the channel
  
   VH1
  
  (then known as "VH-1: Video Hits One"), featuring softer music, and meant to cater to an older demographic than MTV.
  
   MTV Europe
  
  was launched in 1987, and
  
   MTV Asia
  
  in 1991. Another important development in music videos was the launch of
  

    The Chart Show
   

  on the UK's
  
   Channel 4
  
  in 1986. This was a program which consisted entirely of music videos (the only outlet many videos had on British TV at the time
  
   [
   


      citation needed
     


   ]
  
  ), without presenters. Instead, the videos were linked by then state of the art
  
   computer graphics
  
  . The show moved to
  
   ITV
  
  in 1989.
 
  The video for the 1985
  
   Dire Straits
  
  song "
  
   Money for Nothing
  
  " made pioneering use of computer animation, and helped make the song an international hit. Ironically, the song itself was a wry comment on the music-video phenomenon, sung from the point of view of an appliance deliveryman both drawn to and repelled by the outlandish images and personalities that appeared on MTV. In 1986,
  
   Peter Gabriel
  
  's song "
  
   Sledgehammer
  
  " used special effects and animation techniques developed by British studio
  
   Aardman Animation
  
  . The video for "Sledgehammer" would go on to be a phenomenal success
  

    [42]
   

  and win nine MTV Video Music Awards.
 
  In 1988, the MTV show
  

    Yo! MTV Raps
   

  debuted; the show helped to bring
  
   hip hop music
  
  to a mass audience for the first time.
 
  In November 1992,
  
   MTV
  
  began listing
  
   directors
  
  with the artist and song credits, reflecting the fact that music videos had increasingly become an
  
   auteur
  
  's medium. Directors such as
  
   Chris Cunningham
  
  ,
  
   Michel Gondry
  
  ,
  
   Spike Jonze
  
  ,
  
   Floria Sigismondi
  
  ,
  

    [43]
   


   Stéphane Sednaoui
  
  ,
  
   Mark Romanek
  
  and
  
   Hype Williams
  
  all got their start around this time; all brought a unique vision and style to the videos they directed. Some of these directors, including, Gondry, Jonze, Sigismondi,
  

    [44]
   

  and
  
   F. Gary Gray
  
  , went on to direct feature films. This continued a trend that had begun earlier with directors such as
  
   Lasse Hallström
  
  and
  
   David Fincher
  
  .
 
  Two of the videos directed by Romanek in 1995 are notable for being two of the three
  
   most expensive music videos of all time
  
  :
  
   Michael
  
  and
  
   Janet Jackson
  
  's "
  
   Scream
  
  ", which allegedly cost $7 million to produce, and Madonna's "
  
   Bedtime Story
  
  ", which cost a reported $5 million. From this, "Scream" is the most expensive video to date. In the mid to late 1990s,
  
   Walter Stern
  
  directed "
  
   Firestarter
  
  " by
  
   The Prodigy
  
  , "
  
   Bitter Sweet Symphony
  
  " by
  
   The Verve
  
  , and "
  
   Teardrop
  
  " by
  
   Massive Attack
  
  .

  During this period, MTV launched channels around the world to show music videos produced in each local market:
  
   MTV Latin America
  
  in 1993,
  
   MTV India
  
  in 1996, and
  
   MTV Mandarin
  
  in 1997, among others.
  
   MTV2
  
  , originally called "M2" and meant to show more alternative and older music videos, debuted in 1996.
 
  From 1991 to 2001,
  
   Billboard
  
  had its own Music Video Awards.
 
  The website
  
   iFilm
  
  , which hosted short videos, including music videos, launched its service in 1997.
  
   Napster
  
  , a
  
   peer-to-peer file sharing
  
  service which ran between 1999 and 2001, enabled users to share video files, including those for music videos. By the mid-2000s, MTV and many of its sister channels had largely abandoned showing music videos in favor of
  
   reality television
  
  shows, which were more popular with its audiences, and which MTV had itself helped to pioneer with the show
  

    The Real World
   

  , which premiered in 1992.
 
  2005 saw the launch of the website
  
   YouTube
  
  , which made the viewing of online video much faster and easier;
  
   Google Videos
  
  ,
  
   Yahoo! Video
  
  ,
  
   Facebook
  
  and
  
   Myspace
  
  's video functionality use similar technology. Such websites had a profound effect on the viewing of music videos; some artists began to see success as a result of videos seen mostly or entirely online. The band
  
   OK Go
  
  may exemplify this trend, having achieved fame through the videos for two of their songs, "
  
   A Million Ways
  
  " in 2005 and "
  
   Here It Goes Again
  
  " in 2006, both of which first became well-known online (OK Go repeated the trick with another high-concept video in 2010, for their song "
  
   This Too Shall Pass
  
  ").
 
  The 2008 video for
  
   Weezer
  
  's "
  
   Pork and Beans
  
  " also captured this trend, by including at least 20
  
   YouTube celebrities
  
  ; the single became the most successful of Weezer's career, in chart performance. In 2007, the
  
   RIAA
  
  issued cease-and-desist letters to YouTube users to prevent single users from sharing videos, which are the property of the music labels. After its merger with
  
   Google
  
  , YouTube assured the RIAA that they would find a way to pay
  
   royalties
  
  through a bulk agreement with the major record labels.
  
   [
   


      citation needed
     


   ]
  
  This was complicated by the fact that not all labels share the same policy toward music videos: some welcome the development and upload music videos to various online outlets themselves, viewing music videos as free
  
   advertising
  
  for their artists, while other labels view music videos not as an advertisement, but as the product itself.
 
  In 2009,
  
   Thirty Seconds to Mars
  
  ' music video "
  
   Kings and Queens
  
  " was uploaded to YouTube on the same day of its release, where it has garnered over one hundred million views.
  

    [47]
   

  It also received over forty million plays on MySpace. "Kings and Queens" was featured as
  
   iTunes Store
  
  video of the week and was one of the most downloaded videos ever to be featured.
  

    [47]
   

  The video also received four nominations at the
  
   2010 MTV Video Music Awards
  
  , making 30 Seconds to Mars the most nominated rock artist in VMA history for a single year.
  

    [48]
   


  MTV itself now provides streams of artists' music videos, while
  
   AOL
  
  's recently launched AOL Music features a vast collection of advertising supported streaming videos. The Internet has become the primary growth income market for record company-produced music videos.

  At its launch,
  
   Apple
  
  's
  
   iTunes Store
  
  provided a section of free music videos in high quality compression to be watched via the iTunes application. More recently the iTunes Store has begun selling music videos for use on Apple's
  
   iPod
  
  with video playback capability.
 
  To further signify the change in direction towards Music Video airplay, MTV officially dropped the Music Television tagline on February 8, 2010 from their logo in response to their increased commitment to non-scripted reality programming and other youth-oriented entertainment rising in prominence on their live broadcast.
  

    [49]
   



   Vevo
  
  is a music video website launched by several major music publishers in December 2009.
  

    [50]
   

  The videos on VEVO are syndicated to YouTube, with
  
   Google
  
  and VEVO sharing the advertising revenue.
  

    [51]
   


  Following the shift toward internet broadcasting and the rising popularity of user-generated video sites such as
  
   YouTube
  
  around 2006, various
  
   independent filmmakers
  
  began recording live sessions to present on the Web. Examples of this new way of creating and presenting a music video include
  
   Vincent Moon
  
  's work with The Take-Away Shows; In the Van sessions, a similar platform;
  

    [52]
   

  and the Dutch
  
   VPRO
  

   3VOOR12
  
  , which puts out music videos recorded in elevators and other small,
  
   guerrilla filmmaking
  
  type locations in a similar tradition called
  
   Behind
  
  .
  

    [53]
   

  All of these swiftly recorded clips are made with minimal budgets and share similar aesthetics with the
  
   lo-fi music
  
  movement of the early nineties. Offering freedom from the increasingly burdensome financial requirements of high-production movie-like clips, it began as the only method for little-known
  
   indie music
  
  artists to present themselves to a wider audience, but increasingly this approach has been taken up by such major mainstream artists as
  
   R.E.M.
  
  and
  
   Tom Jones
  
  .
  

    [54]
   


  A lyric video is one in which the words to the song are the main element of the video. The music video for
  
   R.E.M.
  
  's "
  
   Fall On Me
  
  " interspersed the song's lyrics with abstract film footage. In 1987,
  
   Prince
  
  released a video for his song "
  
   Sign o' the Times
  
  ". The video featured the song's words pulsing to the music presented along with abstract geometric shapes; an effect created by
  
   Bill Konersman
  
  .
  

    [55]
   



    [56]
   


  In 1990
  
   George Michael
  
  released "Praying For Time" as a lyric video. He had refused to make a traditional music video, so his label released a simple clip that displayed the song's lyrics on a black screen.
  

    [57]
   


  A lyric video may be released separately by a music label prior to the more usual video featuring the artist.
  
   Cee Lo Green
  
  ,
  
   Lady Gaga
  
  ,
  
   Katy Perry
  
  ,
  
   Muse
  
  ,
  
   Blur
  
  ,
  
   Ellie Goulding
  
  ,
  
   Ed Sheeran
  
  and
  
   Avenged Sevenfold
  
  among many others, have released lyric videos.

  As the concept and medium of a music video is a form of artistic expression, artists have been on many occasions censored if their content is deemed offensive. What may be considered offensive will differ in countries due to censorship laws and local customs and ethics. In most cases, the record label will provide and distribute videos edited or provide both censored and uncensored videos for an artist. In some cases, it has been known for music videos to be banned in their entirety as they have been deemed far too offensive to be broadcast.
 
  The first video to be banned by
  
   MTV
  
  was
  
   Queen
  
  's 1982 hit "
  
   Body Language
  
  ". Due to thinly veiled homoerotic undertones plus lots of skin and sweat (but apparently not enough clothing, save that worn by the fully clothed members of Queen themselves), it was deemed unsuitable for a television audience at the time. However, the channel did air
  
   Olivia Newton-John
  
  's 1981 video for the hit song "
  
   Physical
  
  ", which lavished camera time on male models working out in string bikinis who spurn her advances, ultimately pairing off to walk to the men's locker rooms holding hands, though the network ended the clip before the overt homosexual "reveal" ending in some airings. The video for "
  
   Girls on Film
  
  " by
  
   Duran Duran
  
  , which featured topless women mud wrestling and other depictions of sexual fetishes, was banned by the
  
   BBC
  
  . MTV did air the video, albeit in a heavily edited form.
 

   Laura Branigan
  
  initially protested an MTV request to edit her "
  
   Self Control
  
  " video in 1984, but relented when the network refused to air the
  
   William Friedkin
  
  -directed clip, featuring the singer lured through an increasingly debauched, if increasingly stylized, series of nightclubs by a masked man who ultimately takes her to bed. In 1989,
  
   Cher
  
  's "
  
   If I Could Turn Back Time
  
  " video (where the singer performs the song in an extremely revealing body suit surrounded by a ship full of cheering sailors) was restricted to late-night broadcasts on MTV.
  
   The Sex Pistols
  
  ' video for "
  
   God Save the Queen
  
  " was banned by the
  
   BBC
  
  for calling the
  
   United Kingdom
  
  a
  
   fascist
  
  regime.
  
   Mötley Crüe
  
  's video for "
  
   Girls, Girls, Girls
  
  " was banned by MTV for having completely nude women dancing around the members of the band in a strip club.
  
   Mötley Crüe
  
  did make another version of the video that was accepted by MTV.
 
  In 1983,
  

    Entertainment Tonight
   

  ran a segment on censorship and "Rock Video Violence."
  

    [59]
   

  The episode explored the impact of
  
   MTV
  
  rock video violence on the youth of the early 1980s. Excerpts from the music videos of
  
   Michael Jackson
  
  ,
  
   Duran Duran
  
  ,
  
   Golden Earring
  
  ,
  
   Kiss
  
  ,
  
   Kansas
  
  ,
  
   Billy Idol
  
  ,
  
   Def Leppard
  
  ,
  
   Pat Benatar
  
  and
  
   The Rolling Stones
  
  were shown. Dr.
  
   Thomas Radecki
  
  of the National Coalition on TV Violence was interviewed accusing the fledgling rock video business of excessive violence.
  

    Night Tracks
   
   '
  
  producer Tom Lynch weighed in on the effects of the video violence controversy. Recording artists
  
   John Cougar Mellencamp
  
  ,
  
   Gene Simmons
  
  and
  
   Paul Stanley
  
  of Kiss, along with directors Dominic Orlando and
  
   Julien Temple
  
  , provided a defense of their work. The episode's conclusion was that the controversy will continue to grow. Some artists have used censorship as a publicity tool. In the 1980s, the show
  
   Top of the Pops
  
  was censorious in its approach to video content, so some acts made videos that they knew would be censored, using the resulting public controversy to promote their release. Examples of this tactic were
  
   Duran Duran
  
  's aforementioned "Girls on Film" and
  
   Frankie Goes to Hollywood
  
  with "Relax", directed by
  
   Bernard Rose
  
  .
 
  In 1991, the dance segment of
  
   Michael Jackson
  
  's "
  
   Black or White
  
  " was cut because it showed Michael Jackson "inappropriately" touching himself in it. Michael Jackson's most controversial video, "
  
   They Don't Care About Us
  
  " was banned from MTV, VH1, and BBC because of the alleged
  
   anti-Semitic
  
  messages in the song and the visuals in the background of the "Prison Version" of the video.

   Madonna
  
  is the artist most associated with music video censorship. Controversy surrounding Madonna's marketing of her sexuality began with the video for "
  
   Lucky Star
  
  ", and amplified over time due to clips such as "
  
   Like a Virgin
  
  ". Outcry occurred over the subject matter (relating to
  
   teenage pregnancy
  
  ) discussed in the video for the song "
  
   Papa Don't Preach
  
  ". "
  
   Like a Prayer
  
  " courted heavy criticism due to its religious, sexual, and racially oriented imagery. In 1990, Madonna's music video for the song "
  
   Justify My Love
  
  " was banned by MTV due to its depiction of
  
   sadomasochism
  
  ,
  
   homosexuality
  
  ,
  
   cross-dressing
  
  , and
  
   group sex
  
  which generated a media firestorm. The debate over the banning of "Justify My Love" by the Canadian music video network
  
   MuchMusic
  
  led to the launching in 1991 of
  

    Too Much 4 Much
   

  , a series of occasional, late-night specials (still being aired in the early 2000s) in which videos officially banned by MuchMusic were broadcast, followed by panel discussion regarding why they were removed.
 
  In 1992,
  
   The Shamen
  
  's video for the song "
  
   Ebeneezer Goode
  
  " was banned by the
  
   BBC
  
  due to its perceived subliminal endorsement of the recreational drug
  
   Ecstasy
  
  .
  

    [60]
   


   The Prodigy
  
  's 1997 video for "
  
   Smack My Bitch Up
  
  " was banned in some countries due to depictions of drug use and nudity. The Prodigy's video for "
  
   Firestarter
  
  " was banned by the
  
   BBC
  
  because of its references to arson.
  

    [61]
   


  In 1993, Australian rock band
  
   INXS
  
  ' song "
  
   The Gift
  
  " was banned by MTV because of its use of Holocaust and Gulf War footage, among images of famine, pollution, war and terrorism. As well as this, metal band
  
   Tool
  
  's music video for
  

    Prison Sex
   

  was banned from MTV, as the video and lyrics touch on the sensitive matter of child abuse.
 
  In 2000, the music video for "
  
   Rock DJ
  
  " by
  
   Robbie Williams
  
  caused controversy due to the graphic nature of the video which features Williams stripping naked then peeling off his skin to reveal bloody flesh, followed by ripping off his muscles and organs until he is nothing but a blood-soaked skeleton. The video was censored in the UK during daytime hours, and was broadcast unedited after 10pm. The video was banned in
  
   Dominican Republic
  
  due to allegations of
  
   satanism
  
  .
  

    [62]
   


  In 2001,
  
   Björk
  
  's video for "
  
   Pagan Poetry
  
  " was banned from MTV for depictions of sexual intercourse, fellatio, and body piercings. Her next single, "
  
   Cocoon
  
  ", was also banned by MTV as it featured a nude Björk (though the nude body was actually a fitted body suit rigged with red string).
 
  In 2002, the video for "
  
   All the Things She Said
  
  " by Russian duo
  
   t.A.T.u.
  
  caused controversy as it featured the young girls,
  
   Lena Katina
  
  and
  
   Yulia Volkova
  
  , embracing and eventually kissing. UK TV presenters Richard and Judy campaigned to have the video banned claiming it pandered to pedophiles with the use of school uniforms and young girls kissing, although the campaign failed. Capitalizing on the controversy, the kiss was choreographed into their live performances.
  
   Top of the Pops
  
  aired the girls' performance with the kiss replaced by audience footage. NBC's
  
   The Tonight Show with Jay Leno
  
  cut away from the girls' kiss to shots of the band. Throughout their promotional tour, t.A.T.u. protested by appearing in shirts reading "censored".
 
  In 2004,
  
   Maroon 5
  
  's video for "
  
   This Love
  
  " generated controversy due to intimate scenes between frontman
  
   Adam Levine
  
  and his then-girlfriend. Despite those particular scenes being shot at strategic angles, a censored version was released with a stream of
  
   computer-generated
  
  flowers added in to cover up more. The video for "
  
   (s)AINT
  
  " by
  
   Marilyn Manson
  
  was banned by that artist's label due to its violence and sexual content. The following year,
  
   Eminem
  
  's video for "
  
   Just Lose It
  
  " caused controversy over its parody of
  
   Michael Jackson
  
  's

   plastic surgery
  
  , and hair catching fire during the filming of a
  
   Pepsi
  
  commercial. The video was banned from

  In 2004, many family groups and politicians lobbied for the banning of the
  
   Eric Prydz
  
  video "
  
   Call on Me
  
  " for containing women dancing in a sexually suggestive way, however, the video was not banned. In 2008,
  
   Justice
  
  's video for their song "Stress" was boycotted by several major music television channels due to allegations of racism and violence; the video depicts several youths committing various crimes throughout the streets of
  
   Paris
  
  , with the youths mainly being of
  
   North African
  
  descent.

  While country music has largely avoided controversy surrounding video content, it has not been immune. The music video for the 2003
  
   Rascal Flatts
  
  ' song "
  
   I Melt
  
  ," is a case in point, gaining notoriety for clips featuring guitarist
  
   Joe Don Rooney
  
  's bare buttocks, and model Christina Auria taking a shower in the nude.

  The video was the first aired on CMT to show nudity,
  

    [66]
   

  and eventually reached No. 1 on the network's "
  
   Top Twenty Countdown
  
  " program.
  

    [67]
   

  However,
  
   Great American Country
  
  banned the video when the group refused to release an edited version.

  In 2010,
  
   Thirty Seconds to Mars
  
  video "
  
   Hurricane
  
  " was censored because of its major elements of violence, nudity and sex.

  The short film was later released with a clean version that can air on television.
  

    [69]
   

  The explicit version is available on the band's official website with a viewing certificate of 18+.

  In 2010, a rumour circulated that
  
   Lady Gaga
  
  's video "
  
   Telephone
  
  " was banned by MTV, a rumour which reached some press outlets. The rumour claimed that MTV had banned the video because the content could not be shown within their programming. MTV denied the ban and showed the video frequently on European MTV programming.
  

    [71]
   

  Lady Gaga's previous videos have also attracted criticism for their sexually suggestive content; the video for "
  
   LoveGame
  
  " was refused play on the Australian video music program
  

    Video Hits
   

  ; however, other Australian programs aired the video uncensored. The video for
  
   Alejandro
  
  was criticized by the
  
   Catholic League
  
  , for showing the singer dressed in a
  
   red latex fetish
  
  version of a
  
   nun's habit
  
  , simulating rape, and appearing to swallow a
  
   rosary
  
  .

   Ciara
  
  's video for "
  
   Ride
  
  " was banned by
  
   BET
  
  , with the network citing that the video was too sexually charged. The video was also subsequently banned by all UK television channels.
  

    [73]
   



   Rihanna
  
  's video "
  
   S&M
  
  ", which features the singer whipping a tied-up man, taking hostages and indulging in a lesbian kiss, was banned in 11 countries and was flagged as inappropriate for viewers that are under 18 on YouTube.

  Unofficial, fan-made music videos ("bootleg" tapes) are typically made by synchronizing existing footage from other sources, such as television series or movies, with the song. The first known fan video, or
  
   songvid
  
  , was created by Kandy Fong in 1975 using still images from
  
   Star Trek
  
  loaded into a slide carousel and played in conjunction with a song. Fan videos made using
  
   videocassette recorders
  
  soon followed.

  With the advent of easy distribution over the internet and cheap video-editing software, fan-created videos began to gain wider notice in the late 1990s. Videos are sometimes known as OPV, Original Promotional Videos (or sometimes Other People's Videos). A well-known example of an unofficial video is one made for
  
   Danger Mouse
  
  's illegal
  
   mash-up
  
  from his
  

    The Grey Album
   

  , of the
  
   Jay-Z
  
  track
  

    Encore
   

  with music sampled from
  
   The Beatles
  
  '
  

    White Album
   

  , in which concert footage of The Beatles is remixed with footage of Jay-Z and rap dancers.

  In 2004, a
  
   Placebo
  
  fan from South Africa
  

    [77]
   

  made a
  
   claymation
  
  video for the band's song "
  
   English Summer Rain
  
  " and sent it to the band. They liked the result so much that it was included on their greatest hits DVD.
