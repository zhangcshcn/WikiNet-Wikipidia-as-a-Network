  Since the release of iOS 7 users have complained about the link between GPS, WiFi, and the App itself. Some handset owners have noted the App enables and disables itself when passing between cellular protocol bandwidths.

    [update]
   

  , the service is supported on
  
   iPhone
  
  ,
  
   iPad

   iPod Touch
  
  , and
  
   Mac
  
  computers running
  
   OS X 10.7.5 "Lion"
  
  or later.
