   iPhoto
  
  is a
  
   digital photograph
  
  manipulation software application developed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  It was included with every
  
   Macintosh
  

   personal computer
  
  from 2002 to 2015, when it was replaced with Apple's
  
   Photos
  
  application. Originally sold as part of the
  
   iLife
  
  suite of digital media management
  
   applications
  
  , iPhoto can import, organize, edit, print and share
  
   digital photos
  
  .
 


  iPhoto was announced at
  
   Macworld 2002
  
  , during which
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  (then-CEO of Apple) also announced that
  
   OS X
  
  would be installed standard on new
  
   Macs
  
  from then on, and revealed new
  
   iMac
  
  and
  
   iBook
  
  models.

  On March 7, 2012, Apple CEO
  
   Tim Cook
  
  announced an
  
   iOS
  
  -native version of iPhoto alongside the
  
   third-generation iPad
  
  .
  

    [3]
   


  On June 27, 2014, Apple announced that they would cease development of iPhoto and work on a transition to their new
  
   Photos
  
  app.
  

    [4]
   

  On February 5, 2015 Apple included a preview of Photos with a 10.10.3 beta.
  

    [5]
   


  On April 8, 2015, Apple released OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, which includes the new Photos app. iPhoto and Aperture were discontinued and removed from the Mac App Store.
 
  iPhoto is designed to allow the importing of pictures from
  
   digital cameras
  
  , local storage devices such as USB flash drive, CDs, DVDs and hardrives to a user's iPhoto Library. Almost all digital cameras are recognized without additional software. iPhoto supports most common image
  
   file formats
  
  , including several
  
   Raw image formats
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  iPhoto also supports videos from cameras, but editing is limited to trimming clips.

  After photos are imported, they can be titled, labeled, sorted and organized into groups (known as "events"). Individual photos can be edited with basic image manipulation tools, such as a
  
   red-eye
  
  filter, contrast and brightness adjustments, cropping and resizing tools, and other basic functions. iPhoto does not, however, provide the comprehensive editing functionality of programs such as
  
   Apple
  
  's own
  
   Aperture
  
  , or
  
   Adobe
  
  's
  
   Photoshop
  
  (not to be confused with Photoshop
  
   Elements
  
  or
  
   Album
  
  ), or
  
   GIMP
  
  .
 
  iPhoto offers numerous options for sharing photos. Photo albums can be made into dynamic
  
   slideshows
  
  and optionally set to music imported from
  
   iTunes
  
  . Photos can be shared via
  
   iMessage
  
  ,
  
   Mail
  
  ,
  
   Facebook
  
  ,
  
   Flickr
  
  and
  
   Twitter
  
  . Creating and sharing
  
   iCloud Photostreams
  
  are possible as well,
  

    [7]
   

  both public and invitation based ones. iPhoto can also sync photo albums to any
  
   iPod
  
  with a color display. These
  
   iPods
  
  may also have an audio/video output to allow photos to be played back, along with music, on any modern
  
   television
  
  . Additionally, photos can be printed to a local printer, or, in certain markets, be sent over the internet to
  
   Kodak
  
  for professional printing. iPhoto users can order a range of products, including standard prints, posters, cards, calendars, and 100-page hardcover or softcover volumes — again, such services are available only to users in certain markets.

  At an Apple media event on March 7, 2012, Apple CEO
  
   Tim Cook
  
  announced a new version of iPhoto for use on the iOS mobile operating system.
  

    [9]
   

  iPhoto for iOS was made available that day on the
  
   App Store
  
  for
  
   US$
  
  4.99 alongside the already-released
  
   iMovie
  
  and
  
   GarageBand
  
  for iOS. It was officially supported on the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  and later,
  
   iPod Touch
  
  (4th and 5th generations),
  
   iPad 2
  
  and later and
  
   iPad Mini
  
  (1st and 2nd generations), but hackers discovered that it could be installed manually on older devices using Apple's
  
   iPhone Configuration Utility
  
  .

  iPhoto for iOS offered a feature set fairly comparable to that of its Mac counterpart. It could organize photos that were synced to the device or taken with its camera. Editing features included color correction tools and photo effects, as well as cropping and straightening tools. iPhoto for iOS lacked tools for creating books, calendars, cards and ordering prints, though it could create "Photo Journals" – digital photo collages that could be uploaded to Apple's
  
   iCloud
  
  service and shared.
  

    [11]
   


  iPhoto for iOS was highly praised for its professional tools, good performance and compatibility.
  

    [12]
   


  iPhoto for iOS was discontinued in 2015 and removed from the App Store in favor of Photos.
