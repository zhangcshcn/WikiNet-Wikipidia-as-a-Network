   iWork
  
  is an
  
   office suite
  
  of applications created by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  for its
  
   macOS
  
  and
  
   iOS
  

   operating systems
  
  , and also available cross-platform through the
  
   iCloud
  
  website.
 
  It includes
  
   Keynote
  
  , a
  
   presentation program
  
  ; the
  
   word processing
  
  and
  
   desktop publishing
  
  application
  
   Pages
  
  ;
  

    [1]
   



    [4]
   

  and the
  
   spreadsheet
  
  application
  
   Numbers
  
  .
  

    [5]
   

  It is generally viewed as a
  
   prosumer
  
  office suite targeted at home and small business users, with fewer features than competitors such as Microsoft's
  
   Office for Mac
  
  and the open source
  
   LibreOffice
  
  project (and indeed its own earlier versions
  

    [6]
   

  ), but has a simpler user interface, strong
  
   touchscreen
  
  support and built-in links with Apple's iCloud document-hosting service and its Aperture and
  
   iPhoto
  
  image management applications. Apple's design goals in creating iWork have been to allow Mac users to easily create attractive documents and spreadsheets, making use of macOS's extensive font library, integrated spelling checker, sophisticated graphics APIs and its
  
   AppleScript
  
  automation framework.
 
  The equivalent
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  applications to Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are
  
   Word
  
  ,
  
   Excel
  
  , and
  
   PowerPoint
  
  , respectively.
  

    [7]
   

  Although Microsoft Office applications cannot open iWork documents, iWork applications can export documents from their native formats (.pages, .numbers, .key) to Microsoft Office formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt, etc.) as well as to PDF files.
 
  The oldest application in iWork is Keynote, first released as a standalone application in 2003. Pages was released with the first iWork release in 2005; Numbers was added in 2007 with the release of iWork '08. The next release, iWork '09, also included access to
  
   iWork.com
  
  , a beta service that allowed users to upload and share documents,
  

    [5]
   

  now integrated into Apple's
  
   iCloud
  
  service. An iOS port was released in 2010 with the first
  
   iPad
  
  and has been regularly updated since. In 2013, Apple released a new OS X version and iWork for iCloud, a set of cross-platform web applications replicating the native software versions.
 
  iWork was initially sold as a suite for $79, then later at $19.99 per app on OS X and $9.99 per app on iOS. Apple announced in October 2014 that iOS devices purchased from September 2014 onwards and OS X computers purchased from October 2014 onwards,
  

    [8]
   

  whether new or refurbished, are eligible for a free download of all three iWork apps. iWork for iCloud, which also incorporates a document hosting service, is free to all holders of an
  
   iCloud
  
  account.
 
  In September 2016, Apple announced that the real-time collaboration feature will be available for all iWork apps.
  

    [32]
   




  The first version of iWork, iWork '05, was announced on January 11, 2005 at the
  
   Macworld Conference & Expo
  
  and made available on January 22 in the
  
   United States
  
  and worldwide on January 29. iWork '05 comprised two applications: Keynote 2, a presentation creation program, and Pages, a word processor. iWork '05 was sold for US$79. A 30-day trial was also made available for download on Apple's website.

    [11]
   


  While iWork was billed by Apple as "a successor to
  
   AppleWorks
  
  ",
  

    [1]
   

  it does not replicate AppleWorks's
  
   database
  
  and drawing tools.
  

    [12]
   

  However, iWork integrates with existing applications from Apple's
  
   iLife
  
  suite through the Media Browser, which allows users to drag and drop music from
  
   iTunes
  
  , movies from
  
   iMovie
  
  , and photos from
  
   iPhoto
  
  and
  
   Aperture
  
  directly into iWork documents.
  

    [1]
   


  iWork '06 was released on January 10, 2006 and contained updated versions of both Keynote and Pages. Both programs were released as
  
   universal binaries
  
  for the first time, allowing them to run natively on both PowerPC processors and the Intel processors used in the new
  
   iMac
  
  desktop computers and
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  notebooks which had been announced on the same day as the new iWork suite.
  

    [13]
   


  The next version of the suite, iWork '08, was announced and released on August 7, 2007 at a special media event at Apple's campus in
  
   Cupertino
  
  ,
  
   California
  
  . iWork '08, like previous updates, contained updated versions of Keynote and Pages. A new spreadsheet application, Numbers, was also introduced. Numbers differed from other spreadsheet applications, including
  
   Microsoft Excel
  
  , in that it allowed users to create documents containing multiple spreadsheets on a flexible canvas using a number of built-in templates.
  

    [5]
   


  iWork '09, was announced on January 6, 2009 and released the same day. It contains updated versions of all three applications in the suite. iWork '09 also included access to a beta version of the
  
   iWork.com
  
  service, which allowed users to share documents online until that service was decommissioned at the end of July 2012. Users of iWork '09 could upload a document directly from Pages, Keynote, or Numbers and invite others to view it online. Viewers could write notes and comments in the document, and download a copy in iWork,
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  , or
  
   PDF
  
  formats.
  

    [14]
   

  iWork '09 was also released with the Mac App Store on January 6, 2011 at $19.99 per application, and received regular updates after this point, including links to
  
   iCloud
  
  and a high-DPI version designed to match Apple's
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  with
  
   Retina Display
  
  .
  

    [15]
   


  On January 27, 2010, Apple announced iWork for
  
   iPad
  
  , to available as three separate $9.99 applications from the
  
   App Store
  
  .
  

    [16]
   

  This version has also received regular updates including a version for pocket
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPod touch
  
  devices, and an update to take advantage of Retina Display devices and the larger screens of recent iPhones.
 
  On October 22, 2013, Apple announced an overhaul of the iWork software for both the Mac and iOS. Both suites were made available via the respective App Stores. The update is free for current iWork owners
  

    [16]
   

  and was also made available free of charge for anyone purchasing an OS X or iOS device after October 1, 2013.
  

    [17]
   

  Any user activating the newly free iWork apps on a qualifying device can download the same apps on another iOS or OS X device logged into the same App Store account.
 
  The new OS X versions have been criticized
  

    [18]
   

  for losing features such as multiple selection, linked text boxes, bookmarks, 2-up page views, mail merge, searchable comments, ability to read/export
  
   RTF
  
  files, default zoom and page count, integration with
  
   AppleScript
  
  . Apple has provided a road-map for feature re-introduction, stating that it hopes to reintroduce some missing features within the next six months. As of April 1, 2014 a few features—e.g., the ability to set the default zoom—had been reintroduced, though scores had not. In October 2014, writer
  
   John Gruber
  
  commented on the numerous font handling problems that "it's like we're back in 1990 again."
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   


  Due to using a completely new file format that can work across macOS, Windows, and in most
  
   web browsers
  
  by using the online iCloud web apps, means the current version of iWork (iWork 13) does not open or allow editing of documents created in versions prior to iWork 09, with users who attempt to open older iWork files being given a pop-up in the new iWork 13 app versions telling them to use the previous iWork 09 (which users may or may not have on their machine) in order to open and edit such files. Accordingly, the current version for OS X (which was initially only compatible with
  
   OS X Mavericks
  
  10.9 onwards, and now only compatible with
  
   OS X Yosemite
  
  10.10) moves any previously installed iWork 09 apps to an iWork 09 folder on the users machine (in
  
   /Applications/iWork '09/
  
  ), as a work-around to allow users continued use of the earlier suite in order to open and edit older iWork documents locally on their machine.
  

    [21]
   

  In October 2015, Apple released an update to mitigate this cumbersome issue, allowing users to open documents saved in iWork '06 and iWork '08 formats in the latest version of Pages.
  

    [22]
   


  In 2016, Apple announced that the real-time collaboration feature will be available for all iWork apps, instead of being constrained to using
  
   iWork for iCloud
  
  .
  

    [23]
   

  The feature is comparable to
  
   Google Docs
  
  , although as of December 2016 it is still in beta.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   


  Products in the iWork suite share a number of components, largely as a result of sharing underlying code from the
  
   Cocoa
  
  and similar shared
  
   application programming interfaces
  
  (APIs). Among these are the well known universal multilingual
  
   spell checker
  
  , which can also be found in products like
  
   Safari
  
  and
  
   Mail
  
  . Grammar checking, find and replace, style and color pickers are similar examples of design features found throughout the Apple application space.
 
  Moreover, the applications in the iWork suite also share a new
  
   model
  
  of the document. In most document-based applications there is a particular data type which forms the basis of the application's view of the world, for instance, in word processors the text is the first-class citizen of the application, while in a spreadsheet it is the cells in the table. Other objects, images or charts for instance, are managed by being attached to, or referenced to, the underlying primary data type.
 
  In iWork, all of the applications share a common underlying document format, the "canvas", a generic container type that provides layout and storage mechanisms. Each application then adds its own custom objects and places them on the canvas. Pages, for instance, conventionally opens with a single large text object on the canvas. To the user it appears to be a typical word processor, but they can grab the corner and re-size it as in a page layout application. In Numbers, one initially sees a grid of cells like any other spreadsheet, but the user is free to size it smaller than the canvas, and then add multiple grids, charts or even drawings to the same canvas.
 
  The difference is subtle, as many of these features are also implemented in more traditional programs like
  
   Microsoft Excel
  
  . However, the difference in UI can be significant. In Excel, for instance, charts are stored as part of a sheet, and can be moved inadvertently through natural user actions. In Numbers, charts are, like everything else, part of the canvas, and changes to the sheet(s) are normally independent.
 
  The iWork model bears some resemblance to the earlier Apple effort,
  
   OpenDoc
  
  . OpenDoc also used a single underlying document engine, along with a single on-disk format. Unlike iWork, however, OpenDoc also used a single application, in which various editors could be invoked. For instance, one could open a generic document, start a spreadsheet editor, then add a spreadsheet. iWork lacks this level of flexibility in editing terms, but maintains it in layout.
 

   Pages
  
  is a word processing application. The latest edition is Pages 6.0, released in September 2016.
 
  Besides basic word processing functionality, Pages includes templates designed by Apple to allow users to create various types of documents, including
  
   newsletters
  
  , invitations,
  
   stationery
  
  , and
  
   résumés
  
  , along with a number of education-themed templates for students and teachers, such as reports and outlines.
  

    [1]
   



    [5]
   

  Pages 5, a complete redesign, removed more than 100of the features of Pages 4.x, including bookmarks, mail merge, linked text boxes, multiple section capability, ability to set default zoom. It has been slowly adding some back in subsequent 5.x releases (default zoom, for example, can now be set, but still no linked text boxes, multiple select, mail merge, book marks, and more than 90 other features that were present in version 4.3).
 
  Along with Keynote and Numbers, Pages integrates with Apple's iLife suite. Using the Media Browser, users can drag and drop movies, photos and music directly into documents within the Pages application.
  

    [1]
   

  A Full Screen view hides the menubar and toolbars, and an outline mode allows users to quickly create outlines which can easily be rearranged by dragging and dropping, as well as collapsed and expanded. Pages includes support for entering complex equations with
  
   MathType 6
  
  and for reference citing using
  
   EndNote X2
  
  .
  

    [14]
   


  The Pages application can open and edit Microsoft Word documents (including
  
   DOC
  
  and
  
   Office Open XML
  
  files), and
  
   plain text
  
  documents.
  

    [28]
   

  Pages 5 can no longer read or export
  
   rich text format
  
  documents. Pages can also export documents in the DOC, PDF, and ePub formats.
  

    [13]
   

  It cannot read or write
  
   OpenDocument
  
  file formats.
 
  As a word-processing application targeted towards creating attractive documents for a range of applications such as lesson plans and newsletters, Pages competes with
  
   Microsoft Word
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft Publisher
  
  (never ported to OS X), Apple's own free
  
   e-book
  
  and PDF authoring application,
  
   iBooks Author
  
  , and Adobe's professional-market desktop publishing application
  
   InDesign
  
  .
 

   Keynote
  
  is an application used to create and play presentations. Its features are comparable to those of
  
   Microsoft PowerPoint
  
  , though Keynote contains several unique features. Keynote, like Pages and Numbers, integrates with the iLife application suite. Users can drag and drop media from
  
   iMovie
  
  ,
  
   iTunes
  
  ,
  
   iPhoto
  
  and
  
   Aperture
  
  directly into Keynote presentations using the Media Browser. Keynote contains a number of templates, transitions, and effects. Magic Move allows users to apply simple transitions to automatically animate images and text that are repeated on consecutive slides.

  Apple formerly released a Keynote Remote application for iOS that let users view slides and presenter notes and control Keynote presentations with an
  
   iPhone
  
  or
  
   iPod Touch
  
  over a
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  network,
  

    [14]
   

  but that functionality has been rolled into subsequent releases of the main Keynote iOS application.
 
  Keynote supports a number of file formats. By default, presentations are saved as .key files. Keynote can open and edit Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt) files. In addition, presentations can be exported as Microsoft PowerPoint files,
  
   QuickTime
  
  movies (which are also playable on
  
   iPod
  
  and iPhone),
  
   HTML
  
  files, and
  
   PDF
  
  files. Presentations can also be sent directly to
  
   iDVD
  
  ,
  
   iTunes
  
  ,
  
   GarageBand
  
  ,
  
   iWeb
  
  ,
  

    [13]
   

  and to
  
   YouTube
  
  .
  

    [5]
   

  The Keynote 09 file format is not backward compatible; .key files saved with Keynote '09
  
   cannot be opened
  
  with earlier versions of Keynote. The latest version of keynote is Keynote 6.6, released in October 2015.
 

   Numbers
  
  is a spreadsheet application that was added to the iWork suite in 2007 with the release of iWork '08. Numbers, like
  
   Microsoft Excel
  
  and other spreadsheet applications, lets users organize data into tables, perform calculations with formulas, and create charts and graphs using data entered into the spreadsheet. Numbers, however, differs from other spreadsheet applications in that it allows users to create multiple tables in a single document on a flexible canvas. Many prebuilt templates, including ones designed for personal finance, education, and business use, are included.
  

    [5]
   



    [14]
   


  Numbers 2.0 was included with iWork '09, with several improvements. Charts that are pasted into Keynote and Pages are automatically updated across documents when they are changed in Numbers. Additionally, Numbers 2 lets users categorize data in tables by column, which can then be collapsed and summarized.
  

    [14]
   


  Numbers 3.6, the latest version released in October 2015, adds in the ability to open Numbers '08 spreadsheets, among other things.
 
  iWork.com was a free service that enabled users to share iWork '09 documents online directly from within Pages, Keynote and Numbers. Users could click the iWork.com toolbar icon and login using their Apple ID to upload a document and invite others to view it online. Viewers could leave comments and notes on the document and download a copy in iWork, Microsoft Office, or PDF formats. Document owners could track comments at the iWork.com website.
 
  It was released as a
  
   public beta
  
  on January 6, 2009 at the
  
   Macworld Conference & Expo
  
  . The iWork.com service provides a web interface for viewing, downloading, and commenting uploaded documents. In contrast to
  
   cloud-based
  
  office applications such as
  
   Google Docs
  
  and
  
   Office Online
  
  , it does not offer editing.
  

    [30]
   


  iWork.com supported uploading of
  
   Pages '09 documents
  
  ,
  
   Keynote '09 presentations
  
  , and
  
   Numbers '09 spreadsheets
  
  .
  

    [31]
   

  Users could download documents in both
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  and
  
   PDF
  
  formats, in addition to their native iWork formats.
  

    [31]
   

  Uploading documents to iWork.com requires a copy of the iWork '09 software suite and an
  
   Apple ID
  
  . Viewing, commenting, and downloading require only a web browser and an invitation to view the document.
 
  Apple announced that after July 31, 2015, users will be no longer able to publish new documents to iWork.com from any iWork application. Documents stored on iWork.com will not be available to download or view after the shut down date. Instead, users can use iCloud to share documents between their computers (running
  
   OS X Mountain Lion
  
  ) and their
  
   iOS devices
  
  . Users attempting to access the iWork.com site are re-directed to the Apple homepage.
 
  During the 2013
  
   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  (WWDC) keynote speech, iWork for iCloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iWork later in the year. The three apps for both iOS and OS X that form Apple's iWork suite (
  
   Pages
  
  ,
  
   Numbers
  
  , and
  
   Keynote
  
  ), will be made available on a web interface (named as Pages for iCloud, Numbers for iCloud, and Keynote for iCloud respectively), and accessed via the iCloud website under each users iCloud Apple ID login. They will also sync with the users iOS and OS X versions of the app, should they have them, again via their iCloud Apple ID.
 
  Later in 2013, iWork for iCloud update adds support for real-time collaboration
  

    [32]
   

  such that the same document can be opened by collaborators at the same time and everyone can make changes simultaneously. It takes a few seconds for changes to propagate to other collaborators. This, however, cannot work together with iOS and OS X apps, which will cause "out-of-sync" dialogs if editing together with collaborators using iWork for iCloud.
  

    [33]
   

  In 2016, Apple announced that the real-time collaboration feature will be available to iOS and OS X apps.
  

    [34]
   


  This allows the user to edit and create documents on the web, using one of the supported browsers; currently
  
   Safari
  
  ,
  
   Chrome
  
  , and
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  . It also means that
  
   Microsoft Windows
  
  users now have access to these native –previously only Apple device– document editing tools, via the
  
   web interface
  
  . iWork for iCloud has somewhat limited functionality compared to the OS X version. For instance, the fonts available are more limited and the web version doesn't fully support printing and may display documents created with the support of external plug-ins incorrectly/improperly. In 2014, iWork for iCloud update adds 8 languages, 50 new fonts and improved editing in the cloud-based versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   


  On June 7, 2010 while showcasing the new iPhone 4, Apple posted a few screenshots of the device in action and inadvertently showed the possibility of opening an email attachment inside of Keynote, leading some to believe that an iPhone version of the iWork suite would soon be available in the
  
   iOS
  

   App Store
  
  .
  

    [37]
   


  On June 28, 2010, several websites reported that in an attempt to sell AppleCare for the iPhone 4, several examples of services offered were given including one that read, "Using iWork for iPhone and other Apple-branded iPhone apps." These sites also report that it was quickly removed.
  

    [38]
   



    [39]
   


  On May 31, 2011, Apple released a press statement that iWork would be available on the iOS app store for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
  

    [31]
   


  On September 10, 2013, Apple announced that iWork,
  
   iMovie
  
  and
  
   iPhoto
  
  would be available to download for free on new iOS devices activated since September 1.
