  ) is a U.S. city in
  
   Santa Clara County, California
  
  , directly west of
  
   San Jose
  
  on the western edge of the
  
   Santa Clara Valley
  
  with portions extending into the foothills of the
  
   Santa Cruz Mountains
  
  . The population was 58,302 as of the 2010 census.
  

    [6]
   


   Forbes
  
  ranked it as one of the most educated small towns, with local public schools ranking highly in the country. It is known as the home of the
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  corporate headquarters.
 


  Cupertino was named after
  

    Arroyo
   


   San José de Cupertino
  
  (now
  
   Stevens Creek
  
  ). The creek had been named by Spanish explorer
  
   Juan Bautista de Anza
  
  's cartographer, who named it after Saint
  
   Joseph of Cupertino
  
  . Saint Joseph was born Giuseppe Maria Desa, and later known as Giuseppe da Copertino. Joseph of Cupertino was named after the town of
  
   Copertino
  
  in the
  
   Apulia
  
  region of
  
   Italy
  
  . The name Cupertino first became widely used when John T. Doyle, a San Francisco lawyer and historian, named his winery on McClellan Road "Cupertino". After the turn of the 20th century, Cupertino displaced the former name for the region, which was "West Side".
 
  Although the meaning of "Copertino" is uncertain, it is likely a compound word meaning "little (covered) shelter." The -ino suffix in Italian words indicates "small" or "little", while "coprire" in Italian means "to cover", and "coperto" is derived from the Latin "coopertus," which means "covered shelter."
 
  Cupertino in the 19th century was a small rural village at the crossroads of Stevens Creek Road and Saratoga-Mountain View Road (also known locally as Highway 9; later Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, and then renamed to De Anza Boulevard within Cupertino city limits). Back then, it was known as the West Side and was part of Fremont Township. The primary economic activity was fruit agriculture. Almost all of the land within Cupertino's present-day boundaries was covered by
  
   prune
  
  ,
  
   plum
  
  ,
  
   apricot
  
  , and
  
   cherry
  
  orchards. A winery on Montebello Ridge overlooking the Cupertino valley region was also in operation by the late 19th century.
 
  Soon railroads, electric railways, and dirt roads traversed the West Side farmlands.
  
   Monta Vista
  
  , Cupertino's first housing tract, was developed in the mid-20th century as a result of the electric railway's construction.
 
  After
  
   World War II
  
  , a population and suburban housing boom dramatically shifted the demographics and economy of the
  
   Santa Clara Valley
  
  , as the "Valley of Heart's Delight" was beginning to transform into "
  
   Silicon Valley
  
  ". In 1954, a rancher, Norman Nathanson, the Cupertino-Monta Vista Improvement Association, and the Fact Finding Committee, began a drive for incorporation. On September 27, 1955, voters approved the incorporation of the city of Cupertino (225 voted "yes" and 183 voted "no"). Cupertino officially became Santa Clara County's 13th city on October 10, 1955. The first city council consisted of Ralph Lindenmayer, Werner Wilson, John Saich, R. Ivan Meyerholz and Norman Nathanson.
  
   Lindenmayer
  
  was selected as the first mayor of Cupertino a week after the September 27 election.

  A major milestone in Cupertino's development was the creation by some of the city's largest landowners of VALLCO Business and Industrial Park in the early 1960s. Of the 25 property owners, 17 decided to pool their land to form VALLCO Park, 6 sold to
  
   Varian Associates
  
  (property later sold to
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  ), and two opted for transplanting to farms elsewhere. The name VALLCO was derived from the names of the principal developers: Varian Associates and the Leonard, Lester, Craft, and Orlando families. A neighborhood outdoor shopping center and, much later, the enclosed
  
   Vallco Fashion Park
  
  , briefly renamed Cupertino Square, were also developed.
 

   De Anza College
  
  opened in 1967. The college, named for
  
   Juan Bautista De Anza
  
  , occupies a 112-acre (0.45 km
  
   2
  
  ) site that was the location of a winery built at the turn of the 20th century, called Beaulieu by its owners, Charles and Ella Baldwin. Their mansion has now become the California History Center. De Anza College now has about 22,000 students and is a hub of activity in the city. Its flea market, held the first Saturday of the month, attracts thousands from around the area.
 
  Housing developments were rapidly constructed in the following years as developers created neighborhoods, including Fairgrove, Garden Gate,
  
   Monta Vista
  
  , Seven Springs, and other developments. The city is known for its high real estate prices.
 
  On December 1, 2009, Cupertino became the first city in Northern California to have an Asian-American-majority city council.
 
  Cupertino is the 11th wealthiest city with a population over 50,000 in the United States.
 
  63 percent of Cupertino's population was of
  
   Asian
  
  ancestry in 2010,
  

    [11]
   

  compared to 32 percent in Santa Clara Country overall.

   America's best small towns
  
  , ranked Cupertino as #27 in 2012,
  

    [13]
   

  the second highest in California. It was also named as the seventh "happiest" suburb in the United States, ranking highly in the categories of income, safety, marriage, and education.

   per capita income
  
  for the city was $44,774. About 3.6% of families and 5.2% of the population were below the
  
   poverty line
  
  , including 3.9% of those under age 18 and 8.1% of those age 65 or over.

  . The eastern part of the city, located in the
  
   Santa Clara Valley
  
  , is flat while the western part of the city slopes into the

  Cupertino is made up of numerous subdivisions, most of them developed since the 1960s. Most of Cupertino's contemporary properties were developed between 1960 and 1961. The area between Stevens Creek boulevard, Miller avenue, Bollinger road, and Lawrence Expressway contains 224
  
   Eichler
  
  homes.
  

    [22]
   

  Two of the newest parts of Cupertino are among its oldest housing tracts.
  
   Monta Vista
  
  and
  
   Rancho Rinconada
  
  were developed outside of the city's boundaries in the 1950s and before. Rancho Rinconada was annexed in 1999
  

    [23]
   

  and the last part of Monta Vista was annexed in 2004.
  

    [24]
   

  The neighborhood of Seven Springs is at the Southern tip of Cupertino and was developed in the very late 1980s. The newest and most northern neighborhood, Oak Valley, borders Rancho San Antonio Park and was developed around the turn of the millennium.
 
  Cupertino is known for its expensive housing prices as the majority of residential properties are multimillion-dollar homes as of 2015, with the entry-point into a single family home at about 1.5 million dollars. Many homes are in the upper $1 million - $3.5 million range. The high cost of living in Cupertino is attributed to the high-quality schooling (mainly), its location nearest to
  
   Apple
  
  (mainly), safety of the town, and its central location within the Silicon Valley. The city has attracted many high-income professionals and executives many of which are all cash buyers. The price of housing in Cupertino seems to have weathered even the 2009 slump in economy.

  Cali Mill Plaza marks the traditional center of the city and the historical location of Crossroads. However, Cupertino does not have a traditional downtown shopping and commercial district.
 
  Cupertino is one of many cities that claim to be the "heart" of
  
   Silicon Valley
  
  , as many semi-conductor and computer companies were founded there and in the surrounding areas. The worldwide headquarters for
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  is located there in a modern complex circled by the
  
   Infinite Loop
  
  . Apple has announced that it plans to build a new 150-acre (610,000 m
  
   2
  
  )
  
   second campus
  
  between Interstate 280, N Wolfe Rd, E Homestead Rd and along Tantau Ave one mile east of the old campus. The nine properties (50-acre (0.2 km
  
   2
  
  )) south of Pruneridge Avenue were bought in 2006, the property (100-acre (0.4 km
  
   2
  
  ) north of it in 2010 (from
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  ).
 
  On June 7, 2011,
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs.
  

    [25]
   

  The campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building surrounded by extensive landscaping, with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure.
 
  Other companies headquartered in Cupertino include
  
   SugarCRM
  
  ,
  
   Trend Micro
  
  ,
  
   Cloud.com
  
  ,
  
   Lab126
  
  ,
  
   Packeteer
  
  ,
  
   Chordiant
  
  , and
  
   Seagate Technology
  
  . Over 60 high-tech companies have offices there, including
  
   IBM
  
  ,
  
   Olivetti
  
  and
  
   Oracle
  
  . Most of these high-tech companies are located on De Anza Boulevard, Cali Mill Plaza, and Bubb Road.
 
  Though Cupertino is home to the headquarters of many high-tech companies, very little manufacturing actually takes place in the city. The city's large office parks are primarily dedicated to management and design functions.
 
  Earlier in its history Cupertino attributed some of its city income from Vallco Fashion Park, at the time one of the only major indoor shopping malls in the South Bay area. People from the greater South Bay area would come to spend money and contribute to the sales tax. Since then, several other shopping malls have sprung up; Valley Fair (now known as
  
   Westfield Valley Fair
  
  ) in Santa Clara caters to the high end boutique stores, while the
  
   Great Mall
  
  in Milpitas in the 1990s opened to the low-priced and bargain retailers. Vallco Fashion Park was hit hard by these developments, as well as by the loss of one of its anchor stores,
  
   Emporium
  
  .
 
  In 2002, Cupertino had a labor force of 25,780 with an unemployment rate of 4.5%. The unemployment rate for the Santa Clara County as a whole was 8.4%.
 
  One of the major employers in the area is the aggregate rock quarry and
  
   cement
  
  plant in the foothills to the west of Cupertino, the
  
   Permanente Quarry
  
  . Owned and operated by Lehigh Southwest Cement, it was founded by
  
   Henry J. Kaiser
  
  as the Kaiser Permanente Cement Plant in 1939. It provided the majority of the cement used in the construction of the
  
   Shasta Dam
  
  . It supplied the 6 million barrels (950,000 m
  
   3
  
  ) of cement over a nine-mile (14 km)-long conveyor system.
  

    [26]
   

  The cement plant is the sole reason for the railroad line that runs through the city.
 
  Lehigh Permanente Cement was honored as the Large Business of the Year by the Cupertino Chamber of Commerce in 2001–2002. On October 5, 2011, the Lehigh Permanente Cement Plant was the site of a
  
   shooting
  
  in which a disgruntled employee named Shareef Allman shot and killed three people and wounded seven, including one person who was injured during the course of a carjacking by Allman after the shooting. Allman was shot dead after he would not surrender, and displayed a firearm in a threatening manner toward the deputies.

  On December 19, 2011, the Sierra Club sued Lehigh Southwest Cement Company for discharging
  
   selenium
  
  and other toxic waste materials into
  
   Permanente Creek
  
  .

  According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,
  

    [30]
   

  the top employers in the city are:
 
  Cupertino was incorporated in 1955. The highest body in the city government – the City Council – is made up of five members who serve overlapping, four-year terms. The council elects the mayor and vice-mayor for a term of one year. The city does not have its own charter. Instead, it is a General Law city, which follows provisions and requirements for cities established by the state of California.
 
  Cupertino contracts with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Clara County Fire Department for public safety services. The Cupertino Library is part of the Santa Clara County Library System.
 
  The city's symbol is a conquistador's
  
   morion
  
  . A sculpture of this helmet stands next to Cupertino City Hall, and several versions of the helmet have also been used as the city logo. The original sculpture was made in 1971 by John Augsburger of San Luis Obispo. A full-sized replica of the sculpture, made by Fred Subega was given to the city of Toyokawa, Japan as a gift to commemorate their tenth anniversary as sister cities. A smaller sculpture in the shape of the helmet in the 1999–2007 Cupertino city seal was also given to the city of Toyokawa as a twenty-fifth anniversary present.

  The city is served by an interconnected road system. Two
  
   freeways
  
  ,
  
   State Route 85
  
  and
  
   Interstate 280
  
  , intersect in Cupertino, with multi-lane boulevards with landscaped medians and traffic lights at all major intersections. Streets nearly all have sidewalks, the few exceptions are in
  
   unincorporated
  
  pockets at the city's edges, which are maintained directly by Santa Clara County.
 
  Cupertino has
  
   bike lanes
  
  on many of its boulevards. Bicycle traffic is heavy usually around morning and noon times around DeAnza College. The VTA has buses running through Cupertino at major arteries. Cupertino's main streets are well lit, while a few older roads towards the Monta Vista High School area are a little dim.
 
  Dedicated on April 30, 2009, Cupertino opened the
  
   Mary Avenue Bicycle Footbridge
  
  , the first cable-stay bicycle pedestrian bridge over a California freeway. This bridge connects the north and the south sections of the Stevens Creek Trail. The cost of the bridge project was $14,800,000.

  The
  
   Union Pacific Railroad
  
  operates a branch line track up to the
  
   Lehigh Permanente Cement Plant
  
  from the mainline at
  
   San Jose Diridon Station
  
  . It is however strictly for the quarry and very little to no non-quarry traffic runs there.
 
  There is no commuter rail or light rail service in the city.
  
   Caltrain
  
  commuter rail runs through the cities to the north and east, and the
  
   Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
  
  (VTA)'s
  
   Mountain View – Winchester
  

   light rail
  
  line runs to
  
   Campbell
  
  ,
  
   California
  
  to the south. Bus service is also provided by VTA, and the prospect of twenty-four-hour bus service on Stevens Creek Boulevard is being studied. Though this corridor (line 23) is one of VTA's most heavily used routes, there is no express service that takes commuters into
  
   San Jose
  
  , and the quality of service is therefore considered to be relatively poor. VTA recently added a limited bus service to De Anza College from Downtown San Jose via Steven Creeks Blvd (line 323)
 
  Cupertino is landlocked and, like most Bay Area cities, relies on the
  
   Port of Oakland
  
  for most oceangoing freight.
 
  Passenger and cargo air transportation is available at
  
   San Jose International Airport
  
  in San Jose. The closest general aviation airport is in
  
   Palo Alto
  
  ; it is known as
  
   Palo Alto Airport of Santa Clara County
  
  .
 
  Cupertino is known for its high achieving primary and secondary schools. For example,
  
   Murdock-Portal Elementary
  
  and
  
   Faria Elementary School
  
  are tied for highest score for elementary public school in the state of
  
   California
  
  , per
  
   California 2013 API test
  
  scores. As of 2013, John F. Kennedy Middle School is the best public middle school in the state, and Lawson Middle School is the third best in the state. Furthermore, Monta Vista High School is ranked number 23 out of all the public high schools in the nation.
 
  Primary (K-8) public schools are organized into the
  
   Cupertino Union School District
  
  , while the
  
   Fremont Union High School District
  
  is responsible for high school students (except for a tiny portion of the northeast corner of the city which belongs to the
  
   Santa Clara Unified School District
  
  ).
  
   Cupertino High School
  
  and its feeder school,
  
   Hyde Middle School
  
  , are located in the
  
   Rancho Rinconada
  
  section of Cupertino, while
  
   Monta Vista High School
  
  and its feeder,
  
   Kennedy Middle School
  
  , are in the
  
   Monta Vista
  
  neighborhood in the western half of Cupertino.
  
   Lawson Middle School
  
  feeds mostly Cupertino and Monta Vista High. In addition,
  
   Homestead High School
