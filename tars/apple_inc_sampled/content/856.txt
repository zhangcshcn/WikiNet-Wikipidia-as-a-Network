   Fuchsia
  
  is a
  
   capability-based
  
  ,
  
   real-time operating system
  
  (RTOS) being developed by
  
   Google
  
  .
  

    [1]
   

  In contrast to prior Google-developed
  
   operating systems
  
  such as
  
   Chrome OS
  
  and
  
   Android
  
  , which are based on
  
   Linux kernels
  
  , Fuchsia is based on a new
  
   microkernel
  
  named
  
   Magenta
  
  ,
  

    [2]
   

  derived from
  
   Little Kernel
  
  (LK)
  

    [3]
   

  , which was intended for
  
   embedded systems
  
  and is mainly written in the language
  
   C
  
  .
  

    [4]
   

  The Magenta kernel is built for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation",
  

    [5]
   

  meaning both high end smart-phones, desktop computers, and modular systems, like
  
   Project Ara
  
  .

  of the operating system at
  
   GitHub

   infinity symbol
  
  .
 
  It is distributed as
  
   free and open-source software
  
  under a mix of
  
   software licenses
  
  , including
  
   BSD 3 clause
