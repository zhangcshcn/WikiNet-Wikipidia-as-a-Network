  The
  
   Apple A6X
  
  is a
  
   32-bit
  

   system-on-a-chip
  
  (SoC) designed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  , introduced at the launch of the
  
   fourth generation iPad
  
  on October 23, 2012. It is a high-performance variant of the
  
   Apple A6
  
  . Apple claims the A6X has twice the CPU performance and up to twice the graphics performance of its predecessor, the
  
   Apple A5X
  
  .

  The A6X features a 1.4 GHz custom Apple-designed
  
   ARMv7-A
  
  based
  
   dual-core CPU
  
  called Swift,

  and a quad-channel
  
   memory subsystem
  
  .

  The memory subsystem supports LPDDR2-1066 DRAM, increasing the theoretical memory bandwidth to 17 GB/s.

  Unlike the
  
   A6
  
  , but similar to the
  
   A5X
  
  , the A6X is covered with a metal
  
   heat spreader
  
  , includes no RAM, and is not a
  
   package-on-package
  
  (PoP) assembly. The A6X is manufactured by
  
   Samsung
  
  on a
  
   High-κ
  

   metal gate
  
  (HKMG) 32 nm process. It has a die with an area of 123 mm
  
   2
  
  , 30% larger than the A6.
