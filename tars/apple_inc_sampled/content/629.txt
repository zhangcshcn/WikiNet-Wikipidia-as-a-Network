  According to employees, the name "Alienware" was chosen because of the founders' fondness for the hit television series
  

    The X-Files
   

  , which also inspired the science-fiction themed names of product lines such as
  
   Area-51
  
  ,
  
   Hangar 18
  
  , and
  
   Aurora
  
  .

  In 1997, it changed its name to Alienware.
 
  Dell had considered buying the Alienware company since 2002, but did not agree to purchase the company until March 22, 2006.

  The new subsidiary retains control of its design and marketing while benefiting from Dell's purchasing power, economies of scale, and supply chain, which lowered its operating costs.

  Initially, Dell maintained its competing
  
   XPS
  
  line of
  
   gaming PCs
  
  , often selling computers with similar specifications, which may have hurt Alienware's market share within its market segment.

    [14]
   

  Due to corporate restructuring in the spring of 2008, the XPS brand was scaled down, and the Desktop line was eliminated leaving only the XPS Notebooks.
  

    [14]
   

  Product development of gaming PCs was consolidated with Dell's gaming division, with Alienware becoming Dell's premier gaming brand.

  On June 2, 2009, The M17x was introduced as the first Alienware/Dell branded system. This launch also expanded Alienwareâ€™s global reach from 6 to 35 countries while supporting 17 different languages.

  Alienware announced that it will be releasing a series of video
  
   game consoles
  
  starting in 2014, aiming to compete with the
  
   Sony
  

   PlayStation
  
  ,
  
   Nintendo
  

   Wii U
  
  , and the
  
   Microsoft
  

   Xbox
  
  .
  

    [18]
   

  The first version in this series, the Alpha, will run
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  .
  

    [19]
   

  The operating system and ability to play PC games is what separates the Alpha from the
  
   eighth generation of video game consoles
  
  . At E3 2016, Alienware announced the second rendition of the Alpha, the Alpha R2. The R2 adds 6th generation
  
   Intel
  
  processors, a choice of either the
  
   AMD
  

   Radeon
  
  R9 M470X or
  
   Nvidia
  

   GeForce
  
  960 graphics cards, and support for Alienware's proprietary Graphics Amplifier. It also ships with
  
   Windows 10
  
  .

  The Graphics Amplifier allows an Alienware laptop to run most full length (or smaller, non-hybrid) desktop GPUs.

  In 2012, Alienware announced that the M11x model would be discontinued due to decreasing consumer interest in
  
   small form factor
  
  gaming laptops.
  

    [23]
   

  The company went on to offer refreshed models for the rest of their laptop range: the M14x, M17x, and M18x.
