   Windows XP
  
  (stylized as
  
   Windows
   
    xp
   

  and codenamed
  
   Whistler
  
  )
  

    [5]
   

  is a
  
   personal computer
  

   operating system
  
  that was produced by
  
   Microsoft
  
  as part of the
  
   Windows NT
  
  family of operating systems. It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and broadly released for retail sale on October 25, 2001. Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as "
  
   Neptune
  
  ", an operating system built on the
  
   Windows NT kernel
  
  which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer useâ€”an updated version of
  
   Windows 2000
  
  was also originally planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were shelved in favor of a single OS codenamed "Whistler", which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets. Windows XP was a major advance from the
  
   MS-DOS based
  
  versions of
  
   Windows
  
  in security, stability and efficiency
  

    [6]
   

  due to its use of Windows NT underpinnings. It introduced a significantly redesigned
  
   graphical user interface
  
  and was the first version of Windows to use
  
   product activation
  
  in an effort to reduce its
  
   copyright infringement
  
  .
 
  Upon its release, Windows XP received generally positive reviews, with critics noting increased performance (especially in comparison to
  
   Windows ME
  
  ), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and its expanded multimedia capabilities.
  

    [7]
   

  Despite some initial concerns over the new licensing model and product activation system, Windows XP eventually proved to be popular and widely used. It is estimated that at least 400 million copies of Windows XP were sold globally within its first five years of availability,
  

    [8]
   



    [9]
   

  and at least one billion copies were sold by April 2014.
  

    [10]
   

  Sales of Windows XP licenses to
  
   original equipment manufacturers
  
  (OEMs) ceased on June 30, 2008, but continued for
  
   netbooks
  
  until October 2010. Windows XP remained popular even after the release of newer versions, particularly due to the poorly received release of its successor
  
   Windows Vista
  
  . Vista's 2009 successor,
  
   Windows 7
  
  , only overtook XP in total market share at the end of 2011.
  

    [11]
   


  Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8, 2014, after which the operating system
  
   ceased receiving further support or security updates
  
  to most users. As of November 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , Windows XP desktop market share makes it the fourth most popular Windows version after Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. Windows XP is still very popular in some countries; Africa as a whole and in Asia, e.g. in China, with it running on one third of desktop computers (and highest ranked in North Korea
  

    [12]
   



    [13]
   

  ).
 
  In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products; "Odyssey", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future
  
   Windows 2000
  
  , and "
  
   Neptune
  
  ", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the
  
   Windows NT
  
  architecture, succeeding the
  
   MS-DOS
  
  -based
  
   Windows 98
  
  . Based on the NT 5.0 kernel in Windows 2000, Neptune primarily focused on offering a simplified, task-based interface based on a concept known internally as "activity centers", originally planned to be implemented in Windows 98. A number of activity centers were planned, serving as hubs for email communications, playing music, managing or viewing photos, searching the Internet, and viewing recently used content. A single build of Neptune, 5111 (which still carried the branding of Windows 2000 in places), revealed early work on the activity center concept, with an updated user account interface and graphical login screen, common functions (such as recently used programs) being accessible from a customizable "Starting Places" page (which could be used as either a separate window, or a full-screen desktop replacement).
  

    [14]
   



    [15]
   



    [16]
   


  However, the project proved to be
  
   too ambitious
  
  . Microsoft discussed a plan to delay Neptune in favor of an interim OS known as "Asteroid", which would have been an update to Windows 2000 (Windows NT 5.1), and have a consumer-oriented version. At the
  
   WinHEC
  
  conference on April 7, 1999,
  
   Steve Ballmer
  
  announced an updated version of Windows 98 known as
  
   Windows Millennium
  
  , breaking a promise made by Microsoft CEO
  
   Bill Gates
  
  in 1998 that Windows 98 would be the final consumer-oriented version of Windows to use the MS-DOS architecture. Concepts introduced by Neptune would influence future Windows products; in Windows ME, the activity center concept was used for
  
   System Restore
  
  and
  
   Help and Support Center
  
  (which both combined
  
   Win32
  
  code with an interface rendered using
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  's
  
   layout engine
  
  ), the hub concept would be expanded on
  
   Windows Phone
  
  , and
  
   Windows 8
  
  would similarly use a simplified user interface running atop the existing
  
   Windows shell
  
  .
  

    [17]
   



    [18]
   


  In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer
  
   Paul Thurrott
  
  reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed
  
   Whistler
  
  , after
  
   Whistler, British Columbia
  
  , as many Microsoft employees skied at the
  
   Whistler-Blackcomb
  
  ski resort.
  

    [5]
   

  The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform: Thurrott stated that Neptune had become "a black hole when all the features that were cut from [Windows ME] were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project".
  

    [16]
   

  At WinHEC in April 2000, Microsoft officially announced and presented an early build of Whistler, focusing on a new modularized architecture, built-in
  
   CD burning
  
  ,
  
   fast user switching
  
  , and updated versions of the digital media features introduced by ME. Windows general manager Carl Stork stated that Whistler would be released in both consumer- and business-oriented versions built atop the same architecture, and that there were plans to update the Windows interface to make it "warmer and more friendly".
  

    [14]
   



    [16]
   


  In June 2000, Microsoft began the technical beta testing process; Whistler was expected to be made available in "Personal", "Professional", "Server", "Advanced Server", and "Datacenter" editions. At
  
   PDC
  
  on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also released the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an early version of a new visual styles system along with an interim theme known as "Professional" (later renamed "Watercolor"), and contained a hidden "Start page" (a full-screen page similar to Neptune's "Starting Places"), and a hidden, early version of a two-column
  
   Start menu
  
  design.
  

    [19]
   

  Build 2257 featured further refinements to the Watercolor theme, along with the official introduction of the two-column Start menu, and the addition of an early version of
  
   Windows Firewall
  
  .
  

    [16]
   


  Microsoft released Whistler Beta 1, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Build 2410 in January 2001 introduced
  
   Internet Explorer 6.0
  
  (previously branded as 5.6) and the
  
   Microsoft Product Activation
  
  system. Bill Gates dedicated a portion of his keynote at
  
   Consumer Electronics Show
  
  to discuss Whistler, explaining that the OS would bring "[the] dependability of our highest end corporate desktop, and total dependability, to the home", but also "move it in the direction of making it very consumer-oriented. Making it very friendly for the home user to use." Alongside Beta 1, it was also announced that Microsoft would prioritize the release of the consumer-oriented versions of Whistler over the
  
   server-oriented versions
  
  in order to gauge reaction, but that they would be both generally available during the second half of 2001 (Whistler Server would ultimately be delayed into 2003).
  

    [20]
   

  Builds 2416 and 2419 added the
  
   File and Transfer Settings Wizard
  
  and began to introduce elements of the operating system's final appearance (such as its near-final
  
   Windows Setup
  
  design, and the addition of new default wallpapers, such as
  

    Bliss
   

  ).
  

    [21]
   


  On February 5, 2001, Microsoft officially announced that Whistler would be known as
  
   Windows XP
  
  , where XP stands for "experience". As a complement, the next version of
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  was also announced as
  
   Office XP
  
  . Microsoft stated that the name "[symbolizes] the rich and extended user experiences Windows and Office can offer by embracing Web services that span a broad range of devices." In a press event at
  
   EMP Museum
  
  in
  
   Seattle
  
  on February 13, 2001, Microsoft publicly unveiled the new "Luna" user interface of Windows XP. Windows XP Beta 2, build 2462a (which among other improvements, introduced the Luna style), was launched at WinHEC on March 25, 2001.
  

    [22]
   



    [23]
   


  In April 2001, Microsoft controversially announced that XP would not integrate support for
  
   Bluetooth
  
  or
  
   USB 2.0
  
  on launch, requiring the use of third-party drivers. Critics felt that in the case of the latter, Microsoft's decision had delivered a potential blow to the adoption of USB 2.0, as XP was to provide support for the competing,
  
   Apple
  
  -developed,
  
   FireWire
  
  standard instead. A representative stated that the company had "[recognized] the importance of USB 2.0 as a newly emerging standard and is evaluating the best mechanism for making it available to Windows XP users after the initial release."
  

    [24]
   

  The builds prior to and following Release Candidate 1 (build 2505, released on July 5, 2001), and Release Candidate 2 (build 2526, released on July 27, 2001), focused on fixing bugs, acknowledging user feedback, and other final tweaks before the RTM build.
  

    [23]
   


  In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to, in conjunction with
  
   Intel
  
  and other PC makers, spend at least
  
   US$
  
  1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP.
  

    [25]
   

  The theme of the campaign, "Yes You Can", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities; Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan "Prepare to Fly", but it was replaced due to sensitivity issues in the wake of the
  
   September 11 attacks
  
  .
  

    [26]
   

  A prominent aspect of Microsoft's campaign was a U.S. television commercial featuring
  
   Madonna
  
  's song "
  
   Ray of Light
  
  "; a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the song was chosen due to its optimistic tone and how it complemented the overall theme of the campaign.
  

    [27]
   



    [28]
   


  On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was
  
   released to manufacturing
  
  . During a ceremonial media event at
  
   Microsoft Redmond Campus
  
  , copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in
  
   briefcases
  
  , who then flew off on decorated
  
   helicopters
  
  . While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general, retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, "Home" and "Professional".
  

    [23]
   



    [29]
   


  While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased use of
  
   alpha compositing
  
  effects,
  
   drop shadows
  
  , and "
  
   visual styles
  
  ", which completely change the appearance of the operating system. The amount of effects enabled are determined by the operating system by the computer's processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added
  
   ClearType
  
  , a new
  
   subpixel rendering
  
  system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on
  
   liquid-crystal displays
  
  .
  

    [30]
   

  A new set of system icons were also introduced.
  

    [31]
   



    [32]
   

  The default wallpaper,
  

    Bliss
   

  , is a photo of a landscape in the
  
   Napa Valley
  
  outside
  
   Napa, California
  
  , with rolling green hills and a blue sky with
  
   stratocumulus
  
  and
  
   cirrus clouds
  
  .
  

    [33]
   


  The Start menu received its first major overhaul on XP, switching to a two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional cascading "All Programs" menu. The
  
   taskbar
  
  can now group windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a
  
   popup menu
  
  listing the individual windows. The notification area also hides "inactive" icons by default. The taskbar can also be "locked" to prevent accidental moving or other changes. A "common tasks" list was added, and
  
   Windows Explorer
  
  's sidebar was updated to use a new task-based design with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (i.e. a folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).
 
  Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP machine without existing users having to close their programs and logging out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e. monitor, keyboard and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they regained control of the console.
  

    [34]
   


  Windows XP uses
  
   prefetcher
  
  to improve startup and application launch times.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   

  It also became possible to revert the installation of an updated
  
   device driver
  
  , should the updated driver produce undesirable results.
  

    [37]
   


  Numerous improvements were also made to system administration tools such as
  
   Windows Installer
  
  ,
  
   Windows Script Host
  
  ,
  
   Disk Defragmenter
  
  ,
  
   Windows Task Manager
  
  ,
  
   Group Policy
  
  ,
  
   CHKDSK
  
  ,
  
   NTBackup
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft Management Console
  
  ,
  
   Shadow Copy
  
  ,
  
   Registry Editor
  
  ,
  
   Sysprep
  
  and
  
   WMI
  
  .
  

    [38]

      further explanation needed
     


   ]
  

  Windows XP introduced a
  
   copy protection
  
  system known as
  
   Windows Product Activation
  
  . All Windows licenses must be tied to a unique ID generated using information from the
  
   computer hardware
  
  , transmitted either via the internet or a telephone hotline. If Windows is not activated within 30 days of installation, the OS will cease to function until it is activated. Windows also periodically verifies the hardware to check for changes. If significant hardware changes are detected, the activation is voided, and Windows must be re-activated.
  

    [39]
   


  Windows XP was originally bundled with
  
   Internet Explorer 6
  
  ,
  
   Outlook Express
  
  6,
  
   Windows Messenger
  
  , and
  
   MSN Explorer
  
  . New networking features were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall,
  
   Internet Connection Sharing
  
  integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling,
  
   Background Intelligent Transfer Service
  
  , extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer networking, support for most
  
   DSL
  
  modems,
  
   IEEE 802.11
  
  (
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  ) connections with
  
   auto configuration
  
  and roaming,
  
   TAPI 3.1
  
  , and networking over FireWire.
  

    [40]
   


   Remote Assistance
  
  and
  
   Remote Desktop
  
  were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the
  
   Internet
  
  and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help.
  

    [41]
   

  Improvements were also made to
  
   IntelliMirror
  
  features such as
  
   Offline Files
  
  ,
  
   Roaming user profiles
  
  and
  
   Folder redirection
  
  .
 
  Some of the programs and features that were part of the previous versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP.
  
   CD Player
  
  ,
  
   DVD Player
  
  , and
  
   Imaging for Windows
  
  are replaced with
  
   Windows Picture and Fax Viewer
  
  ,
  
   Windows Media Player
  
  , and Windows shell.
  
   NetBEUI
  
  and
  
   NetDDE
  
  are
  
   deprecated
  
  and are not installed by default.
  
   DLC
  
  and
  
   AppleTalk
  
  network protocols are removed.
  
   Plug-and-playâ€“incompatible
  
  communication devices (like
  
   modems
  
  and
  
   network interface cards
  
  ) are no longer supported.
 

   Service Pack 2
  
  and
  
   Service Pack 3
  
  also remove features from Windows XP but to a less noticeable extent. For instance,
  
   Program Manager
  
  and support for
  
   TCP half-open
  
  connections are removed in Service Pack 2. The
  
   Energy Star
  
  logo and the address bar on the taskbar are removed in Service Pack 3.
 
  Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch;
  
   Home Edition
  
  , and
  
   Professional
  
  . Both editions were made available at retail as pre-loaded software on new computers, and in boxed copies. Boxed copies were sold as "Upgrade" or "Full" licenses; the "Upgrade" versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install. The "Full" version can be installed on systems without an operating system or existing version of Windows.
  

    [25]
   

  Both versions of XP were aimed towards different markets;
  
   Home Edition
  
  is explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on
  
   Professional
  
  , such as the ability to join a
  
   Windows domain
  
  ,
  
   Internet Information Services
  
  , and
  
   Multilingual User Interface
  
  . Windows 98 or ME can be upgraded to either version, but
  
   Windows NT 4.0
  
  and Windows 2000 can only be upgraded to
  
   Professional
  
  .
  

    [43]
   

  Windows'
  
   software license agreement
  
  for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be "returned" to the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it.
  

    [44]
   

  Despite the refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.
  

    [45]
   



    [46]
   


  Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types of hardware, exclusively through
  
   OEM
  
  channels as pre-loaded software.
  

    Windows XP Media Center Edition
   

  was initially designed for high-end
  
   home theater PCs
  
  with
  
   TV tuners
  
  (marketed under the term "Media Center PC"), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an
  
   electronic program guide
  
  , and
  
   digital video recorder
  
  (DVR) support through the
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  application.
  

    [47]
   

  Microsoft also unveiled
  

    Windows XP Tablet PC Edition
   

  , which contains additional
  
   pen input
  
  features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its
  
   Tablet PC
  
  specifications.
  

    [48]
   

  Two different
  
   64-bit
  
  editions of XP were made available; the first,
  
   Windows XP 64-Bit Edition
  
  , was intended for
  
   IA-64
  
  (
  
   Itanium
  
  ) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in favor of
  
   AMD
  
  's
  
   x86-64
  
  architecture (which was supported by the later
  
   Windows XP Professional x64 Edition
  
  ), the Itanium version was discontinued in 2005.
  

    [49]
   


  Microsoft also targeted
  
   emerging markets
  
  with the 2004 introduction of
  

    Windows XP Starter Edition
   

  , a special variant of
  
   Home Edition
  
  intended for low-cost PC's. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners, containing heavy
  
   localization
  
  (including wallpapers and screen savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a "My Support" area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain "complex" features, and does not allow users to run more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in
  
   India
  
  and
  
   Thailand
  
  ,
  
   Starter
  
  was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005.
  

    [50]
   

  In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the
  
   FlexGo
  
  initiative, which would also target emerging markets with
  
   subsidized
  
  PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.
  

    [51]
   


  As the result of
  
   unfair competition
  
  lawsuits in
  
   Europe
  
  and
  
   South Korea
  
  , which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was ordered to release special versions of XP in these markets that excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the
  
   European Commission
  

   fined
  
  Microsoft â‚¬497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft was ordered to release "N" versions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own
  
   media player
  
  software. As it was sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as
  
   Dell
  
  , who offered it for a short period, along with
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  ,
  
   Lenovo
  
  and
  
   Fujitsu Siemens
  
  ) chose not to offer it. Consumer interest was minuscule, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to
  
   OEMs
  
  , and no reported sales to consumers.
  

    [52]
   



    [53]
   



    [54]
   



    [55]
   

  In December 2005, the
  
   Korean Fair Trade Commission
  
  ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger.
  

    [56]
   

  The "K" and "KN" editions of Windows XP were released in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean, and also contain links to third-party
  
   instant messenger
  
  and media player software.
  

    [57]
   


  Three
  
   service packs
  
  were released for Windows XP, containing various bug fixes and the addition of certain features. Each service pack is a superset of all previous service packs and patches so that only the latest service pack needs to be installed, and also includes new revisions.
  

    [58]
   


  Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support,
  
   Microsoft Java Virtual Machine
  
  ,
  
   .NET Framework
  
  support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming
  
   Media Center
  
  and
  
   Tablet PC
  
  editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of
  
   Set Program Access and Defaults
  
  , a settings page which allows programs to be set for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This feature was added to comply with the settlement of
  

    United States v. Microsoft Corp.
   

  , which required Microsoft to offer the ability for OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it bundles with Windows, and give them the same level of prominence as those normally bundled with the OS (such as
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  and
  
   Windows Media Player
  
  ).

  On February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). This release removed Microsoft Java Virtual Machine as a result of a lawsuit with
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  .
  

    [62]
   


  Service Pack 2 (SP2) was released on August 25, 2004,
  

    [63]
   

  SP2 added new functionality to Windows XP, such as
  
   WPA
  
  encryption compatibility and improved Wi-Fi support (with a wizard utility), a
  
   pop-up ad
  
  blocker for Internet Explorer 6, and partial
  
   Bluetooth
  
  support.
 
  Service Pack 2 also added new security enhancements (codenamed "Springboard"),
  

    [64]
   

  which included a major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now enabled by default),
  
   Data Execution Prevention
  
  gained hardware support in the
  
   NX bit
  
  that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks.
  
   Raw socket
  
  support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by
  
   zombie machines
  
  ) and the
  
   Windows Messenger service
  
  (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added
  
   Security Center
  
  , an interface which provides a general overview of the system's security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates. Third-party firewall and
  
   antivirus software
  
  can also be monitored from Security Center.
  

    [65]
   


  In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b) to contain a patch requiring ActiveX controls to be manually activated in accordance with a patent held by
  
   Eolas
  
  .
  

    [66]
   



    [67]
   

  Microsoft has since licensed the patent, and released a patch reverting the change in April 2008.
  

    [68]
   

  In September 2007, another minor revision known as SP2c was released for XP Professional, extending the number of available
  
   product keys
  
  for the operating system to "support the continued availability of Windows XP Professional through the scheduled system builder channel end-of-life (EOL) date of January 31, 2009."
  

    [69]
   


  Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) was released to manufacturing on April 21, 2008, and to the public via both the Microsoft Download Center and
  
   Windows Update
  
  on May 6, 2008.
  

    [70]
   



    [71]
   



    [72]
   



    [73]
   


  It began being automatically pushed out to
  
   Automatic Updates
  
  users on July 10, 2008.
  

    [74]
   

  A feature set overview which details new features available separately as stand-alone updates to Windows XP, as well as
  
   backported
  
  features from Windows Vista, has been posted by Microsoft.
  

    [75]
   

  A total of 1,174 fixes have been included in SP3.
  

    [76]
   

  Service Pack 3 can be installed on systems with Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, or 8.
  

    [77]
   

  Internet Explorer 7 is not included as part of SP3.
  

    [78]
   

  Service Pack 3 is not available for the 64 bit version of Windows XP, which is based on Windows Server 2003 kernel.
 
  Service Pack 3 also incorporated several previously released key updates for Windows XP, which were not included up to SP2, including:
 
  Service Pack 3 contains updates to the operating system components of Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which is included in these editions. However, it does not include update rollups for the Windows Media Center application in Windows XP MCE 2005.
  

    [87]
   

  SP3 also omits security updates for Windows Media Player 10, although the player is included in Windows XP MCE 2005.
  

    [87]
   

  The Address Bar DeskBand on the Taskbar is no longer included due to antitrust violation concerns.
  

    [88]
   


  System requirements for Windows XP are as follows:
 

   Notes:
  

  The maximum amount of RAM that Windows XP can support varies depending on the product edition and the processor architecture, as shown in the following table.
  

    [99]
   



    [100]
   


  Windows XP Professional supports up to two physical processors
  

    [102]
   

  (CPU sockets);
  

    [103]
   

  Windows XP Home Edition is limited to one.
  

    [104]
   


  Windows XP supports a greater number of logical processors. A logical processor is either: 1) One of the two handlers of threads of instructions in one of the cores of a physical processor with support for
  
   hyper-threading
  
  present and enabled; or 2) one of the cores of one of the physical processors without enabled support for hyper-threading. Windows XP 32-bit editions support up to 32 logical processors;
  

    [105]
   

  64-bit editions support up to 64 logical processors.
  

    [106]
   


  Support for Windows XP without a service pack ended on September 30, 2005.
  

    [4]
   

  Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a were retired on October 10, 2006,
  

    [4]
   

  and Windows XP Service Pack 2 reached end of support on July 13, 2010, almost six years after its general availability.
  

    [4]
   

  The company stopped general licensing of Windows XP to OEMs and terminated retail sales of the operating system on June 30, 2008, 17 months after the release of Windows Vista.
  

    [111]
   



    [112]
   

  However, an exception was announced on April 3, 2008, for OEMs producing what it defined as "ultra low-cost personal computers", particularly
  
   netbooks
  
  , until one year after the availability of
  
   Windows 7
  
  (October 22, 2010). Analysts felt that the move was primarily intended to compete against
  
   Linux
  
  -based netbooks, although Microsoft's Kevin Hutz stated that the decision was due to apparent market demand for low-end computers with Windows.
  

    [113]
   



    [114]
   



    [115]
   


  Variants of Windows XP for
  
   embedded systems
  
  have different support policies: Windows XP Embedded SP3 and Windows Embedded for Point of Service SP3 were supported until January and April 2016, respectively.
  
   Windows Embedded Standard 2009
  
  and
  
   Windows Embedded POSReady 2009
  
  , will be supported (while "mainstream" support has ended) through January and April 2019, respectively.
  

    [116]
   


  On April 14, 2009, Windows XP exited mainstream support and entered the Extended Support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows XP; however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014, over 12 years since the release of XP; normally Microsoft products have a support life cycle of only 10 years.
  

    [117]
   

  Beyond the final security updates released on April 8, no more security patches or support information are provided for XP free-of-charge; "critical patches" will still be created, and made available only to customers subscribing to a paid "Custom Support" plan.
  

    [117]
   



    [118]
   



    [119]
   

  As it is a Windows component, all versions of Internet Explorer for Windows XP also became unsupported.
  

    [120]
   


  Microsoft continued to provide
  
   Security Essentials
  

   virus definitions
  
  and updates for its
  
   Malicious Software Removal Tool
  
  (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015.
  

    [121]
   

  As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could
  
   reverse engineer
  
  security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP.
  

    [122]
   



    [123]
   



    [124]
   

  On March 8, 2014, Microsoft deployed an update for XP that, on the 8th of each month, displays a pop-up notification to remind users about the end of supportâ€”these notifications may be disabled by the user.
  

    [125]
   

  Microsoft also partnered with Laplink to provide a special "express" version of its
  
   PCmover
  
  software to help users migrate files and settings from XP to a computer with a newer version of Windows.
  

    [125]
   



    [126]
   


  Despite the approaching end of support, there were still notable holdouts that had not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of
  
   Windows Vista
  
  , sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined due to the
  
   Great Recession
  
  and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (especially those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows).
  

    [127]
   



    [128]
   



    [129]
   



    [130]
   

  Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) plan to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of
  
   Google Chrome
  
  ,
  
   Mozilla Firefox
  
  , and
  
   Opera
  
  web browsers;
  

    [120]
   

  despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform.
  

    [127]
   



    [129]
   



    [131]
   



    [132]
   



    [133]
   


  As of January 2014, at least 49% of all computers in
  
   China
  
  still ran XP. These holdouts have been influenced by several factors; prices of genuine copies of Windows in the country are high, while Ni Guangnan of the
  
   Chinese Academy of Sciences
  
  warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to
  
   surveillance by the United States government
  
  , and the
  
   Chinese government
  
  would ban the purchase of Windows 8 products for government use in May 2014 in protest of Microsoft's inability to provide "guaranteed" support. The government also had concerns that the impending end of support could affect their
  
   anti-piracy
  
  initiatives with Microsoft, as users would simply pirate newer versions rather than purchasing them legally. As such, government officials formally requested that Microsoft extend the support period for XP for these reasons. While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo,
  
   Kingsoft
  
  and
  
   Tencent
  
  , will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP.
  

    [129]

    [135]
   



    [136]
   



    [137]
   

  Several governments, in particular the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate "Custom Support" plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government's deal lasts for a year, also covers support for
  
   Office 2003
  
  (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost
  
   Â£
  
  5.5 million.
  

    [133]
   



    [138]
   



    [139]
   


  In January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million
  
   automated teller machines
  
  in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced
  
   IBM
  
  's
  
   OS/2
  
  as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven and ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15. Plans were being made by several ATM vendors and their customers to migrate to Windows 7-based systems over the course of 2014, while vendors have also considered the possibility of using Linux-based platforms in the future to give them more flexibility for support lifecycles, and the
  
   ATM Industry Association (ATMIA)
  
  has since endorsed
  
   Windows 10
  
  as a further replacement.
  

    [140]
   

  However, ATMs typically run the embedded variant of Windows XP, which was supported through January 2016.
  

    [141]
   



    [142]
   


  Similarly specialized devices that run XP, particularly
  
   medical devices
  
  , must have any revisions to their softwareâ€”even security updates for the underlying operating systemâ€”approved by relevant regulators before they can be released. For the same reason, manufacturers of medical devices had historically refused to provide, or even allow the installation of any Windows updates for these devices, leaving them open to security exploits and malware.
  

    [139]
   



    [143]
   


  On May 1, 2014, despite the end of support for the operating system, Microsoft released an emergency patch to correct a major, recently discovered security exploit in the Internet Explorer browser on all versions of Windows (including Windows XP).
  

    [144]
   



    [145]
   


  Windows XP is
  
   remotely exploitable
  
  by numerous security holes that were discovered after Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP.
  

    [146]
   



    [147]
   



    [148]
   




  On release, Windows XP received mostly positive reviews.
  
   CNET
  
  described the operating system as being "worth the hype", considering the new interface to be "spiffier" and more intuitive than previous versions, but feeling that it may "annoy" experienced users with its "hand-holding". XP's expanded multimedia support and CD burning functionality was also noted, along with its streamlined networking tools. The performance improvements of XP in comparison to 2000 and ME were also praised, along with its increased number of built-in device drivers in comparison to 2000. The software compatibility tools were also praised, although it was noted that some programs, particularly older MS-DOS software, may not work correctly on XP due to its differing architecture. They panned Windows XP's new licensing model and product activation system, considering it to be a "slightly annoying roadblock", but acknowledged Microsoft's intent for the changes.
  

    [149]
   



    PC Magazine
   

  provided similar praise, although noting that a number of its online features were designed to promote Microsoft-owned services, and that aside from quicker boot times, XP's overall performance showed little difference over Windows 2000.
  

    [150]
   


  According to
  
   web analytics
  
  data generated by
  
   Net Applications
  
  , Windows XP was the most widely used operating system until August 2012, when Windows 7 overtook it.
  

    [151]
   

  In January 2014, Net Applications reported a market share of 29.23% of "desktop operating systems" for XP (when XP was introduced there wasn't a separate mobile category to track), while
  
   W3Schools
  
  reported a share of 11.0%.
  

    [152]
   



    [153]
   


  According to web analytics data generated by StatOwl, Windows XP had a 27.82% market share as of November 2012, having dropped to second place in October 2011.
  

    [154]
   


  According to web analytics data generated by W3Schools, from September 2003 to July 2011, Windows XP was the most widely used operating system for accessing the w3schools website, which they claim is consistent with statistics from other websites. As of August 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , Windows XP market share was at 3.6% after having peaked at 76.1% in January 2007.
  

    [153]
   


  As of November 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , Windows XP desktop market share, according web analysis (as a proxy for all use) shows significant variation in different parts of the world, but is on average at 4.66% (according to NetMarketshare 8.45%
  

    [155]
   

  ) ranked after three other versions of Windows
  

    [156]
   

  by StatCounter's numbers (2.31% across all platforms
  

    [157]
   

  ); for example, in North America usage of Windows XP has dropped to 2.06%, but in Africa it is still at 10.29%
  

    [158]
   

  and in Asia at 6.39%
  

    [159]
   

  (even higher in China, but down to 18.21%, tied with Win10 at second
  

    [160]
   

  ) while going down, and has been overtaken by Windows 10.
