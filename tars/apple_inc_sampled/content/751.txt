  The
  
   MacBook Air
  
  is a line of
  
   Macintosh
  

   subnotebook computers
  
  developed and manufactured by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  It consists of a full-size
  
   keyboard
  
  , a
  
   machined
  

   aluminum
  
  case, and a thin light structure. The Air is available with a screen size of (measured diagonally) 13.3in (29.46 cm), with different specifications produced by Apple, and as of 2011, all models use
  
   solid-state drive
  
  storage and
  
   Intel Core
  
  i5 or i7
  
   CPUs
  
  .
  

    [2]
   

  A MacBook Air with an 11.6in (23.78 cm) screen was made available in 2010 and was discontinued on October 27, 2016.
  

    [3]
   


  In the current product line, the MacBook Air sits below the performance-range of the
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  and compared to the
  
   MacBook Retina
  
  , its features reflect different priorities. The Air was originally released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the previous
  
   MacBook
  
  .
  

    [4]
   

  Since then, the Air has become Apple's entry-level laptop due to the MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, as well as lowered prices on subsequent iterations.

   Steve Jobs
  
  introduced the first MacBook Air during a speech at his keynote at the 2008
  
   Macworld
  
  conference on January 15, 2008.
  

    [6]
   

  The first-generation MacBook Air was a 13.3"-only model, initially promoted as the world's thinnest notebook.
  

    [7]
   

  It featured a custom
  

    [8]
   


   Intel
  

   Merom
  
  CPU and
  
   Intel GMA
  
  graphics. In late 2008, the CPU was updated to a faster, non-custom
  
   Penryn
  
  CPU and integrated
  
   Nvidia
  

   GeForce
  
  graphics while the hard drive capacity was increased and the
  
   micro-DVI
  
  video port was replaced by the
  
   Mini DisplayPort
  
  .
  

    [9]
   

  A mid-2009 refresh, introduced alongside the
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  family, featured a slightly higher-capacity battery, and a faster Penryn CPU.
  

    [10]
   


  On October 20, 2010, Apple released a redesigned 13.3" model, with improved enclosure, screen resolution, battery, and flash storage instead of a hard drive. In addition, a new 11.6" model was introduced, offering reduced cost, weight, battery life, and performance relative to the 13.3" model, but better performance than typical
  
   netbooks
  
  of the time.
  

    [11]
   



    [12]
   



    [13]
   



    [14]
   


  On July 20, 2011, Apple released updates to the 11.6" and 13.3" models of the MacBook Air, which also became Apple's entry-level laptops due to lowered prices and the discontinuation of the white MacBook around the same time.
  

    [5]
   

  The mid-2011 MacBook Airs were powered by the new
  
   Sandy Bridge
  
  1.6 or 1.7 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or 1.8 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processors, that came with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor, and with a backlit keyboard, two USB 2.0 ports, FaceTime camera, a standard of 2 GB of RAM (configurable up to 4 GB),
  
   Thunderbolt
  
  which shares function with Mini DisplayPort and
  
   Bluetooth
  
  was upgraded to
  
   v4.0
  
  .
  

    [15]
   



    [16]
   

  Maximum SSD flash memory storage options were increased up to 256 GB. Both 11" and 13" models had an analog audio output/headphone minijack (that also supports an iPhone/iPod touch headset with microphone), but only the 13" model had an integrated SDXC-capable SD Card slot. These models use a less expensive "Eagle Ridge" Thunderbolt controller that provides two Thunderbolt channels (2 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional), compared to the MacBook Pro which uses a "Light Ridge" controller that provides four Thunderbolt channels (4 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional). A USB ethernet adapter was immediately available upon release and a Thunderbolt-to-Firewire 800 adapter became available in mid-year 2012.
 
  On June 11, 2012, Apple released an updated model in the same
  
   form factor
  
  as the prior model. The new model is powered by the new
  
   Ivy Bridge
  
  dual-core Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, doubles the RAM and SSD speeds, has the new USB 3 ports (with USB 2 capability) in place of the USB 2 ports and the new
  
   MagSafe
  
  2 charging port.
  

    [17]
   

  The camera was upgraded to 720p FaceTime HD.
 
  On June 10, 2013, Apple released another update in the same form factor as the 2012 model during the company's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). The 11" and 13" models have a minimum standard 4 GB RAM, with a maximum configuration of 8 GB. Both models are powered by the
  
   Haswell ULT
  
  1.3 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processors, with Turbo Boost up to 2.6 GHz, while a 1.7 GHz Dual-Core i7, with Turbo Boost up to 3.3 GHz, option is also available. Each model's storage standard is 128 GB SSD, upgradeable to 256 GB and 512 GB SSD. Due to
  
   Haswell
  
  CPUs, battery life has considerably improved from the previous generation, and the mid-2013 models are capable of 9 hours on the 11" model and 12 hours on the 13" model; a team of reviewers exceeded expected battery life ratings during their test.
  

    [18]
   


  While Apple's
  
   MacBook
  
  lines have been affected towards consumer trend to
  
   smartphones
  
  ,
  

    [19]
   

  they still managed to ship 2.8M Macs in Q2 2012, notably Air, compared to 500K total Ultrabooks,
  

    [20]
   



    [21]
   

  despite there being dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11" and 13" models of it.
  

    [22]
   

  While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around Ultrabook in regard to "OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction".
  

    [23]
   

  The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and Apple
  
   OS X
  
  has gained market share on Windows in recent years.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   

  Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56% of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, despite being one of the higher-priced competitors.
  

    [26]
   


  The MacBook Air is designed for thinness, and is also lighter than most competing models.
  

    [27]
   

  The computer features a
  
   glossy
  

   LED
  

   backlit
  

   display
  
  and a full-size keyboard, as well as a large
  
   trackpad
  
  that responds to
  
   multi-touch
  
  gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating.
  

    [28]
   

  With the release of
  
   Snow Leopard
  
  , the Air's trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters.
  

    [29]
   


  On the 11" Air, the left side of the computer has a
  
   MagSafe
  
  power connector, a
  
   USB
  
  port, a headphone jack, and a microphone.
  

    [28]
   

  The right side of the computer has a
  
   USB
  
  port and a
  
   Mini DisplayPort
  
  , now sharing
  
   Thunderbolt
  
  function beginning with the 2011 model. On top of the screen bezel there is a webcam, first dubbed
  
   iSight
  
  and now the
  
   FaceTime
  
  camera.
 
  The MacBook Air was the first subcompact laptop offered by Apple since the full-featured 12"
  
   PowerBook G4
  
  was discontinued in 2006. It was also Apple's first computer with an optional
  
   solid-state drive
  
  .
  

    [30]
   


   ArsTechnica
  
  found "moderate" performance improvements of the 64
  
   GB
  


    [note 1]
   

  solid-state drive of the first-generation Air over the standard 80GB
  
   hard drive
  
  in tests. On October 14, 2008, new models were announced with improved capacities of 128GB SSD and 120GB hard drive. For the late-2010 Air, only
  
   flash storage
  
  is available, in 64/128GB capacities on the 11" model, and 128/256GB on the 13".
 
  The
  
   CPU
  
  in the first-generation MacBook Air was a custom
  
   Intel Core 2 Duo
  

   Merom
  
  that was 40% of the size of the standard chip package.
  

    [31]
   

  For models of late 2008, the CPU was replaced with a low-voltage
  
   Penryn
  
  chip with 6MB of cache, running on a 1066 MHz bus.
  

    [32]
   


  Air components are officially non-user-replaceable, though third-parties do sell upgrade kits for the SSDs. The flash memory and battery are enclosed within the casing, with RAM soldered onto the motherboard. The flash memory, difficult to access, has a 128MB cache
  

    [33]
   

  and a
  
   mSATA
  
  connection (updated to a proprietary PCIe interface) to the motherboard.
  

    [34]
   

  The battery can be replaced using normal screwdrivers, though it is unclear whether this process does void warranty.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   

  As part of the warranty service, Apple can replace the battery for a fee.
  

    [37]
   


  Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of
  
   lead
  
  to make it more environmentally friendly. The MacBook Air contains no
  
   BFRs
  
  and
  
   PVC
  
  wiring, meets
  
   Energy Star
  
  5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated
  
   EPEAT
  
  Gold. Its display is made from
  
   arsenic
  
  -free glass, and contains no
  
   mercury
  
  .
  

    [7]
   



    [38]
   

  To reduce the computer's size and weight, several features were sacrificed. It was Apple's first notebook since the
  
   PowerBook 2400c
  
  without a built-in
  
   removable media
  
  drive.
  

    [39]
   

  It also omits a
  
   FireWire
  
  port,
  
   Ethernet
  
  port,
  
   line-in
  
  , media card slots (except the 13" 2010 through 2015 models, which have an SD card slot), and a
  
   Kensington Security Slot
  
  .
  

    [40]
   


  To gain optical drive features, users could either purchase an external USB
  
   SuperDrive
  
  or other brand, or the bundled Remote Disc software, only for browsing or software installation to access the drive of another computer wirelessly
  

    [41]
   

  that has the program installed.
  

    [42]
   



    [43]
   

  It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD. Remote Disc supports
  
   NetBooting
  
  , so the Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer's drive, which requires
  
   Remote Install Mac OS X
  
  to be running on that computer. The software does not allow playback or information of
  
   DVDs
  
  ,
  
   CDs
  
  or installing
  
   Windows
  
  .
  

    [41]
   

  For these features, an external USB drive is required.
  

    [41]
   

  More recent versions of OS X replaced the installation DVD with a
  
   USB flash drive
  
  containing the software, eliminating remote installation.
 
  The 2010 models include two speakers for stereo sound while earlier versions have one speaker located under the keyboard. The 2011 model replaces DisplayPort with a Thunderbolt 1 port, and also has a
  
   1280×720
  
  FaceTime HD Camera, replacing the previous
  
   640×480
  
  iSight camera. The 2012 model replaces USB 2 with USB 3, and uses the MagSafe 2 instead of the MagSafe connector for charging. The 2015 model updated the Thunderbolt port to Thunderbolt 2.

       Optional Apple Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 Adapter
      


  Although the 11" Air is only slightly lighter than the 13" Air, the biggest difference is the footprint which gives each model a distinct category; the 13” Air is much closer in size to most other conventional laptops, while the 11” Air is almost small enough to fit in a space that can hold an
  
   iPad
  
  .
  

    [57]
   



    [58]
   


  Since 2011, the MacBook Air and iPad have supplanted the
  
   netbook
  
  as a computing device of choice between a smartphone and a full-fledged laptop.
  

    [57]
   



    [58]
   

  The 11" MacBook Air carried the desirable essential attributes of a
  
   netbook
  
  , but without the drawbacks of a slower processor and less capable operating system
  
   [1]
  
  , albeit at a higher price.
  

    [59]
   



    [60]
   



    [61]
   



    [62]
   



    [63]
   

  At the high end of the performance spectrum of Apple's compact computing devices, the 11.6" MacBook Air has revolutionized ultra-light portables with a traditional keyboard and display, which made fewer performance sacrifices albeit at considerably higher production cost.
  

    [64]
   



    [65]
   

  At the low end, Apple introduced the
  
   iPad
  
  —a different form factor than the netbook, but with improved computing capabilities and lower production cost. Both of these led to a decline in netbook sales, and most PC manufacturers have consequently discontinued their netbook lines in response.
  

    [66]
   

  Capitalizing on the success of the MacBook Air,
  

    [67]
   

  Intel promoted
  
   Ultrabook
  
  as a new high-mobility standard, which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed.
  

    [68]
   



    [69]
   



    [70]
   



   Intel
  
  developed a set of specifications for the
  
   Ultrabook
  
  , a higher-end type of
  
   subnotebook
  
  produced by various PC manufacturers and usually running Windows. Competing directly with the Air, the Ultrabook is intended to reduce size and weight, and extend battery life without compromising performance.
  

    [71]
   



    [72]
   



    [73]
   


  The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   

  Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, despite being one of the higher-priced competitors.
  

    [26]
   

  Apple has traditionally dominated the premium PC market, in 2009 having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $1,000, according to NPD, and Ultrabooks were an attempt by other PC manufacturers to move in on Apple's turf.
  

    [74]
   

  While Apple's
  
   MacBook
  
  lines have not been immune to this consumer trend towards mobile devices,
  

    [19]
   

  they still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks,
  

    [20]
   



    [21]
   

  despite there being dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11" and 13" models of the Macbook Air.
  

    [22]
   


   Forrester Research
  
  analyst Frank Gillett attributes Apple's increased success in the enterprise market to the 2010 MacBook Air and the iPad.
  

    [75]
   


  While several
  
   Ultrabooks
  
  were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the MacBook Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around Ultrabook in regard to "OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction".
  

    [23]
   


  The
  
   Microsoft Surface Pro
  
  has a similar size and price to the 11" MacBook Air;
  

    [76]
   



    [77]
   

  Apple CEO
  
   Tim Cook
  
  has criticized the Surface Pro and other Ultrabook hybrids running the touch-based
  
   Windows 8
  
  , that attempt to combine laptop and tablet functionality in one device, saying that such devices were confusing like trying to "combine a fridge and a toaster".
  

    [78]
   



    [79]
   


  When released in October 2010, the 13" model's screen resolution was higher than the average 1366x768 screens of similar sized laptops. However, by mid-2013, with many premium Ultrabooks having high resolution screens (1080p or greater) as standard or upgrades, the MacBook Air has been increasingly criticized for sticking with a low-resolution screen. Many in the tech community had expected Apple to release a MacBook Air with
  
   Retina Display
  
  by mid-2013, similar to the
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  Retina which came out in 2012.
  

    [80]
   

  The October 2013 refresh of the 13" MacBook Pro Retina, with a slimmer chassis and a lower price point, is mentioned as a potential MacBook Air alternative as the battery life is not much shorter while not being considerably bulkier.
  

    [4]
   



    [81]
   

  Apple released an entry-level version of the 13" MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016, which was specifically targeted towards MacBook Air users.
  

    [82]
   


  At the launch of the first MacBook Air in January 2008, Apple claimed it to be the thinnest laptop in the world. While this was true of laptops on sale at the time, the 2003 Sharp Actius MM10 Muramasas was thinner at some points than the Macbook Air, being 0.54 inches (14 mm) thick at its minimum.
  

    [83]
   

  It, like the MacBook Air, was a tapered design, with a maximum height of 0.78 inches (20 mm)—slightly thicker than the MacBook Air.
  

    [84]
   

  The Sony Vaio X505, released in 2004, had a minimum thickness of 0.38 inches (10 mm) and a maximum of 0.8 inches (20 mm).
  

    [85]
   


  Since the release of the first MacBook Air, other thinner laptops have been released, such as the
  
   Dell Adamo
  
  ,
  

    [86]
   

  launched in March 2009, which is a constant 0.65 inches (17 mm) thick. Apple subsequently removed "The world's thinnest notebook" from their marketing materials.
 
  The 11.6" MacBook Air, introduced in October 2010, is only slightly larger and heavier (when closed) than the
  
   iPad 2
  
  . The 11.6" Air has been regarded as thin and light compared to other ultraportables, such as the Sony VAIO Z and the 11" Samsung Series 9.
  

    [87]
   


  As of 2013, several Ultrabooks such as the Sony VAIO Pro have managed smaller dimensions than the MacBook Air by using carbon fiber construction.
  

    [88]
   



    [89]
   



    [90]
   


  Following its introduction, the MacBook Air was greeted with a mixed reception. The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, but the compromise in features was criticized.
  

    [91]
   



    [92]
   



    [93]
   

  The full-sized keyboard, weight, thinness, and
  
   Multi-Touch
  
  trackpad were appreciated in reviews, while the limited configuration options and ports, slow speed (in non-SSD models), non-user-replaceable battery, small hard drive, and price were criticized.
  

    [91]
   



    [92]
   

  The flip-down hatch on the side of the original MacBook Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and
  
   USB
  
  devices, requiring users to purchase an extension cable. Apple removed the flip-down hatch on the late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports, as is the case with most other laptops.
  

    [94]
   



    [95]
   


  Most of these problems have been dismissed by now, following many revisions and speed enhancements, and with the addition of more portability and ports.

  Since the release of the first-generation product, some MacBook Air users have complained of CPU lockup caused by overheating. Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results: the deactivation of one CPU core was corrected; however, the runaway kernel problem remained for some users.
  

    [96]
   

  The problem is aggravated by system-intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting.
  

    [97]
   


  Due to a more mature manufacturing process, the CPUs in the second-generation MacBook Air perform better under load, as the first generation chips ran at a higher temperature—the processor needed to be throttled to avoid overheating and this further degraded performance.
  

    [98]
   


  On October 17, 2013, Apple announced a replacement program for the 64 GB and 128 GB MacBook Air flash storage drives that are installed in Air systems purchased between June 2012 and June 2013.
