  The
  
   iPod Touch
  
  (stylized and marketed as
  
   iPod touch
  
  ) is an
  
   iOS
  
  -based all-purpose
  
   handheld PC
  
  designed and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  with a
  
   user interface
  
  that is
  
   touchscreen-based
  
  . It can be used as a
  
   music and video player
  
  ,
  
   digital camera
  
  ,
  
   handheld game
  
  device, and
  
   personal digital assistant
  
  (PDA).
  

    [5]
   

  It connects to the Internet only through
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  base stations, does not use
  
   cellular network
  
  data, and is therefore not a
  
   smartphone
  
  , though it has a similar design to the
  
   iPhone
  
  and is often referred to as the "iPhone without a phone". Furthermore, it does not fit in Apple's iPhone accessories such as their leather cases. As of May 2013, 100 million iPod Touch units had been sold. It is also the most popular iPod model.
  

    [1]
   


  iPod touch models are sold by storage space and color, with all models of the same generation typically offering otherwise identical features, processors, and performance, in addition to available operating system upgrades; an exception was the
  
   fifth generation
  
  , as the low-end (16Â GB
  

    [6]
   

  ) model was initially sold without a rear-facing camera.
  

    [7]
   

  The current iPod touch is the
  
   sixth-generation model
  
  , released on July 15, 2015.
 


  The iPod Touch runs Apple's
  
   Unix-based
  
  iOS
  
   operating system
  
  (called 'iPhone OS' until 2010) and includes bundled software to browse the Internet, view maps, send and receive email, view media, and work with office documents such as presentations and spreadsheets. Users type on a
  
   virtual keyboard
  
  displayed on the
  
   screen
  
  . Apple operates an online
  
   store
  
  , allowing users to buy and directly download music, videos and third-party software. From launch, the iPod Touch was described by journalists as an 'iPhone without the phone',
  

    [8]
   

  and each iPod Touch model to date has been introduced with the same
  
   release number
  
  of iOS as the contemporary iPhone model.
 
  Successive updates to iOS since the initial release in 2007 have released additional features.
  
   iPhone OS
  
  2.0, released on July 11, 2008, introduced the
  
   App Store
  
  , which allowed third-party applications for the first time. iPhone OS 3.0, released on June 17, 2009, added features such as cut, copy, and paste,
  
   data tethering
  
  and
  
   push notification
  
  support. iOS 4.0, released on June 21, 2010, introduced
  
   iBooks
  
  ,
  
   FaceTime
  
  , and multitasking. It dropped support for the first generation iPod Touch.
 
  In June 2011, iOS 5, the fifth major release of iOS software, was announced at Apple's
  
   WWDC 2011
  
  , which added notification,
  
   messaging
  
  and reminder features.
  

    [9]
   

  Apple limited some features, most notably the voice control system
  
   Siri
  
  , to the iPhone.
  

    [10]
   


   iOS 6
  
  , which was released on September 19, 2012 to the fourth and
  
   fifth generation
  
  iPod Touch models, contains 200 new features including
  
   Passbook
  
  ,
  
   Facebook
  
  integration and
  
   Apple Maps
  
  . The fifth generation iPod Touch gained the ability to take panoramic photos, a feature shared with the
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  and
  
   iPhone 5
  
  .
  

    [11]
   


  On June 8, 2015, it was announced at the
  
   WWDC
  
  that the iPod Touch fifth generation would support
  
   iOS 9
  
  , along with other
  
   A5
  
  devices. This makes the iPod Touch fifth generation the only iPod Touch to support 4 major versions of iOS.
 
  Recent iOS updates have been free for owners of supported iPod Touch models, but Apple received criticism for charging iPod Touch owners for versions 2.0 and 3.0, which iPhone owners received for free, and for excluding certain features from the iPod Touch software that the iPhone included.
  

    [12]
   



    [13]
   

  Apple's position was that they could add features for free to the iPhone because the revenue from it is accounted for on a subscription basis under accounting rules, rather than as a one time payment.
  

    [14]
   

  At WWDC in June 2010, as of iOS 4, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had "found a way" to make subsequent OS upgrades available free to iPod Touch owners.
 
  To purchase content on the iPod Touch, the user must create an
  
   Apple ID
  
  or have an existing account. With this account one may download music and videos from the
  
   iTunes Store
  
  , apps from the
  
   App Store
  
  , or books from the
  
   iBookstore
  
  . An Apple ID account created without a credit card can be used to get free content, and gift cards can be bought to pay for apps instead of using credit cards. This is convenient for users who want to purchase an
  
   app
  
  ,
  
   song
  
  , video, or
  
   E-book
  
  , but they do not have a
  
   credit card
  
  .
 
  The only official way to obtain third-party applications for the iPod Touch is Apple's
  
   App Store
  
  , which is a branch of
  
   iTunes Store
  
  . The App Store application, available in all versions of iOS from 2.0 onwards, allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository (hosted by Apple) with the iTunes Store. To develop such software, a
  
   software development kit
  
  (SDK) was officially announced on March 6, 2008, at an Apple Town Hall meeting.
  

    [15]
   

  The
  
   iOS SDK
  
  allows making applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team. The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70% of money earned. Apple retains 30% of the sale price with no minimum fixed fee.
 
  Like all Apple's iOS devices, the iPod Touch is a tightly controlled or
  
   closed platform
  
  . Modifying or replacing the operating system violates the device warranty, communication between apps is limited and controlled, and Apple is the only authorized software vendor. Hackers have attempted to 'jailbreak' all iOS devices to enable forbidden or unsupported features, such as multitasking in iOS versions before 4.0, themes for the home screen and the use of software Apple has refused to sell such as a battery percentage indicator. Jailbreaks for the iPod Touch first surfaced a month after the first model was released in September 2007, when
  
   hackers
  
  released
  
   JailbreakMe
  
  1.0 (also called "AppSnapp") to
  
   jailbreak
  
  iPhone OS 1.1.1.
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   

  This allowed users to install third-party programs on their devices before Apple permitted this.
 
  As of August 2014, each version of iOS on iPod Touches can be jailbroken using tools such as
  
   PwnageTool
  
  ,
  
   redsn0w
  
  ,
  
   Absinthe
  
  , both versions of
  
   evasi0n
  
  , and Pangu.

  Apple's warranty statement implies that an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modification made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple's warranty. Jailbreaking is a violation of the Terms and Conditions for using iOS. The jailbreaking process can normally be undone by performing a restore through iTunes.
  

    [18]
   


  The iPod Touch is generally similar to the
  
   iPhone
  
  . Compared to a same-generation iPhone, an iPod Touch is thinner, lighter and less expensive, while lacking some hardware and software features.
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  once referred to the iPod Touch as "training wheels for the iPhone".
  

    [19]
   


  All iPods lack
  
   Touch ID
  
  ,
  
   3D Touch
  
  ,
  
   NFC
  
  ,
  
   GPS
  
  , an earpiece speaker and a
  
   noise-cancelling microphone
  
  . Depending on the generation, the iPod Touch may have a smaller or inferior display and camera(s). Newer models (5th and 6th generation) lack the ambient light sensor that makes automatic brightness available. Older models lack a built in speaker, a microphone, a camera, and a flash. An iPod Touch also has a comparably shorter battery life than an iPhone does.

  No iPod Touch has a modem through which it can place phone calls or send SMS and MMS. However, 5th and 6th generation models can either piggy-back on iPhones using
  
   Continuity
  
  or use
  
   VOIP
  
  and
  
   online SMS services
  
  to provide this functionality.
 
  For iPod Touch units bought before October 12, 2011 users must own a Mac or PC computer to be able to use the iPod. Users then must install iTunes and connect the iPod through a
  
   USB
  
  port. The iPod will then be set up in iTunes. New iPods bought after October 12, 2011 have iOS 5.0 preloaded, and allow activation wirelessly, without the need of a PC or Mac.
  

    [20]
   


  Earlier iPod Touch units must be plugged into a computer to be synced. This will charge the iPod Touch and sync the music library, videos, pictures and backup data. iOS 5 enables the user to do all this from the device and send it to the
  
   iCloud
  
  service, which supports Mac OS X Lion and later.
 
  Starting with the second generation model, the iPod Touch dropped support charging from the 12 V pin of a FireWire cable.
  

    [21]
   

  Charging the iPod Touch takes about 2 hours (80 per cent capacity) for fast charge, and full charge takes about 4 hours.

  The
  
   iPod Touch (fifth generation)
  
  and
  
   iPhone 5
  
  feature a new
  
   dock connector
  
  , named "
  
   Lightning
  
  ", which replaces the Apple Dock connector on older iPhone,
  
   iPad
  
  , iPod models. The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one allowing a slimmer form factor. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way around. Various accessories are available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older Apple Dock connector or
  
   USB
  
  ,
  

    [22]
   

  although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available.

  As of July 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , there are six types of produced iPod Touch devices.
