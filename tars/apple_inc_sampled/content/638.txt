  In 2000
  
   Dell
  
  announced that it would lease 80,000 square feet (7,400 m
  
   2
  
  ) of space in the Las Cimas office complex to house the company's executive offices and corporate headquarters, which were moving from
  
   Round Rock, Texas

  In January 2001 the company leased the space in Las Cimas 2, located along
  
   Loop 360

   2

  After a slowdown in business required reducing employees and production capacity, Dell decided to sublease its offices in two buildings in the Las Cimas office complex.
  

    [8]
   

  In 2002 Dell announced that it planned to sublease its space to another tenant; the company planned to move its headquarters back to Round Rock once a tenant was secured.

  By 2003 Dell moved its headquarters back to Round Rock. It leased all of Las Cimas I and II, with a total of 312,000 square feet (29,000 m
  
   2
  
  ), for about a seven-year period after 2003. By that year roughly 100,000 square feet (9,300 m
  
   2
  
  ) of that space was absorbed by new subtenants.

  Challenger International Ltd. purchased Las Cimas II and III for $63 million in 2002. Challenger merged with CPH Investment Corp. in 2003, so its name changed to Challenger Financial Services Group Ltd.

   Vitesse Semiconductor
  
  Corp. leased 14,375 square feet (1,335.5 m

  In the fourth quarter of 2010 American Campus Communities, Dell, Keller Williams, and St. Jude vacated about 160,000 square feet (15,000 m
  
   2
  
  ) of space within Las Cimas. Most of the vacation of space was due to a firm moving its offices to other locations in
  
   Greater Austin
