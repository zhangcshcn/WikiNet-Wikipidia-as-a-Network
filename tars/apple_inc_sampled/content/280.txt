  An
  
   iPod click wheel game
  
  or
  
   iPod game
  
  is a
  
   video game
  
  playable on the various versions of the
  
   Apple
  
  portable media player, the
  
   iPod
  
  . The original iPod had the game
  

    Brick
   

  (originally invented by Apple co-founder
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  ) included as an
  
   easter egg
  
  hidden feature; later
  
   firmware
  
  versions added it as a menu option. Later revisions of the iPod added three more games in addition to
  
   Brick
  
  :
  

    Parachute
   

  ,
  

    Solitaire
   

  , and
  
   Music Quiz
  
  . These games should not be confused with games for the
  
   iPod Touch
  
  , which require
  
   iOS
  
  and are only available on Apple's
  
   App Store
  
  on
  
   iTunes
  
  .
 


  In September 2006, the
  
   iTunes Store
  
  began to offer nine additional games for purchase with the launch of
  
   iTunes 7
  
  , compatible with the
  
   fifth generation iPod
  
  with iPod software 1.2 or later. Those games were:
  

    Bejeweled
   

  ,
  
   Cubis 2
  
  ,
  

    Mahjong
   

  ,
  

    Mini
   

    Golf
   

  ,
  

    Pac-Man
   

  ,
  

    Tetris
   

  ,
  

    Texas Hold 'Em
   

  ,
  

    Vortex
   

  , and
  

    Zuma
   

  . These games were made available for purchase from the iTunes Store for
  
   US$
  
  4.99 each. In December 2006 two more games were released by
  
   EA Mobile
  
  at the same price:
  
   Royal
   
    Solitaire
   

  and
  

    Sudoku
   

  . In February 2007,
  

    Ms. Pac-Man
   

  was released followed in April 2007 by
  

    iQuiz
   

  . Until this time, all the available games could be purchased in a package, with no discount.
 
  In May 2007 Apple released
  

    Lost: The Video Game
   

  based on the
  
   television show
  
  , which is made by
  
   Gameloft
  
  . In June 2007 "
  
   SAT
  
  Prep 2008" by
  
   Kaplan
  
  . This was introduced as 3 separate educational games based on the subjects writing, reading, and mathematics. In December 2007, Apple released
  
   Sega
  
  's classic game;
  
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  
  , which was originally packaged with the
  
   Sega Genesis
  
  system in the early 1990s.
 
  With third parties like
  
   Namco
  
  ,
  
   Square Enix
  
  ,
  
   EA
  
  ,
  
   Sega
  
  , and
  
   Hudson Soft
  
  all making games for the iPod, Apple's MP3 player has taken great steps towards entering the video game handheld console market. Even video game magazines like
  
   GamePro
  
  &
  
   EGM
  
  have reviewed and rated most of their games as of late.
 
  The games are in the form of .ipg files (iPod game), which are actually .zip archives in disguise. When unzipped, they reveal executable files along with common audio and image files, leading to the possibility of
  
   third party games
  
  . Currently, Apple has no publicly available
  
   software development kit
  
  (SDK) for iPod-specific development.

  The
  
   iOS SDK
  
  covers only
  
   iOS
  
  on the
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  , not traditional iPods.
 
  As of October 2011, Apple has removed all the click-wheel operated games from its store.
 
  This is a list of games available for the newest iPods, excluding the iPod Touch. Each game (other than Reversi and Chinese Checkers) costs
  
   US$
  
  4.99 to buy.
 
  These are the games that originally came with an iPod.

  iTunes had come under much criticism due to the
  
   UK
  
  price of iPod games,
  
   GBÂ£
  
  3.99 (about US$7.40). Many people from the UK had given the games 1* ratings, stating that Apple was
  
   "ripping off" Britain
  
  .

  A similar situation occurred in
  
   Australia
  
  , where the price was
  
   A$
  
  7.49, even though the Australian dollar (was at the time) worth more than the US dollar (A$7.49 = US$7.76).
 
  Developers had criticized Apple for not creating a
  
   software development kit
  
  (SDK) for software developers to create new iPod games. This was likely to keep the
  
   digital rights management
  
  of iPod games closed.

  Although technically speaking this does not prevent the running of an alternative OS on the iPod such as Linux, whereby for example there are ports of Doom that will run on fifth-generation iPods. Interestingly, running Linux on an iPod retains the music playing functionality of the device, while adding features such as the ability to create voice memos through the headphones.
 
  When the iPod Classic and iPod Nano third generation were released, games which were bought formerly could not be synced to the new iPods. This made many consumers angry due to losing their investment.
 
  It is also notable that after a download had been made for a game, it couldn't have been downloaded again unless a separate purchase was made for the same item.

  This is different behavior than applications downloaded on the App Store, which can be downloaded multiple times. This issue was later fixed, making it possible to install any single game on any number of iPods.
 
  Some older iPod units are capable of using replacement
  
   firmware
  
  such as
  
   iPod Linux
  
  and
  
   Rockbox
  
  . These firmware projects can play many other games including a native port of
  

    Doom
   

  , and via a native port of the
  
   Game Boy
  

   emulator
  

   Gnuboy
  
  many other games including
  

    Super Mario
   

  ,
  

    Tomb Raider
   

  ,
  

    Mega Man
   

  ,
  

    Kirby
   

  ,
  

    Metroid
   

  ,
  

    The Legend of Zelda
   

  ,
  

    Street Fighter
   

  , and hundreds more.
