  This is a list and comparison of devices designed and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  that run a
  
   Unix-like
  

   operating system
  
  named
  
   iOS
  
  , often colloquially referred to simply as iDevices.

  The devices include the
  
   iPhone
  
  multimedia
  
   smartphone
  
  , the
  
   iPod Touch
  

   handheld PC
  
  which, in design, is similar to the iPhone, but has no cellular radio and other
  
   cell phone
  
  hardware, and the
  
   iPad
  

   tablet computer
  
  . All three devices function as
  
   digital audio
  
  and
  
   portable media
  
  players and
  
   Internet
  
  clients. The
  
   Apple TV
  
  , which ran
  
   iOS
  
  from the second generation of hardware onward, is a
  
   set-top box
  
  for streaming media from local sources and from certain internet services to a connected television set, and has no screen of its own. About 1.35 billion iOS devices have been sold worldwide as of March 2015.

  The operating system on iOS devices can be updated through
  
   iTunes
  
  , or, on
  
   iOS 5
  
  or later, using
  
   over-the-air
  
  (
  
   OTA
  
  ) updates. A major version of iOS tends to be released every time a new type of iPhone is launched, (usually once a year) with minor changes throughout the year as needed. All updates are free to iOS devices (although iPod Touch users were formerly required to pay for the update). Apple upgrades its products' hardware periodically (approximately yearly).

  The second generation of
  
   Apple TV
  
  onwards runs
  
   iOS
  
  . (The first generation ran a modified version of
  
   Mac OS X Tiger
  
  instead of
  
   iOS
  
  .)
 
  Apple runs tests on pre-production units to determine battery life. However, these are purported maximums ("up to"), and actual user experiences vary.

  Apple has increased the storage capacity of its devices over time. Units were or are available with a given storage capacity as indicated.
 
  This table indicates the supported versions of
  
   iOS
  
  available for each generation of iOS devices. Beta versions may be listed only if support is discontinued for some older devices.
 
  The 3Â½-inch display introduced with the original iPhone was almost unchanged in all models before 2010. The iPad has a larger display and also uses a different aspect ratio and resolution. The
  
   iPhone 4
  
  ,
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  , and fourth generation iPod Touch keep the physical dimensions of prior models, but double the resolution in both dimensions, thereby quadrupling the number of pixels in the same amount of space. The
  
   iPhone 5
  
  was the first departure from the traditional
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  screen size, increasing it from 3.5" to 4", and the resolution was increased to include the extra screen space. The
  
   iPhone 6
  
  and
  
   iPhone 6 Plus
  
  were the second departure from the traditional iPhone and iPod Touch screen size, increasing the screen sizes from 4" to 4.7" and 5.5" with increased resolution to include the extra screen space.
