  Paul Allen was born on January 21, 1953 in
  
   Seattle, Washington
  
  to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen.
  

    [11]
   

  Allen attended
  
   Lakeside School
  
  , a private school in Seattle, where he befriended
  
   Bill Gates
  
  , three years younger, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers.
  

    [12]
   

  They used Lakeside's
  
   Teletype
  
  terminal to develop their programming skills on several
  
   time-sharing
  
  computer systems.
  

    [12]
   

  After graduation, Allen went to
  
   Washington State University
  
  , where he joined
  
   Phi Kappa Theta
  
  fraternity,
  

    [13]
   

  but
  
   dropped out
  
  after two years in order to work as a programmer for
  
   Honeywell
  
  in
  
   Boston
  
  , near where
  
   Bill Gates
  
  had ended up as well.
  

    [12]
   

  Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of
  
   Harvard University
  
  in order to create Microsoft. Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a]
  
   leave
  
  [of absence]."
  

    [14]
   


  In
  
   Albuquerque, New Mexico
  
  , Paul Allen with his friend Bill Gates, in 1975, began marketing a
  
   BASIC
  
  programming language interpreter.
  

    [12]
   

  Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," as recounted in a 1995
  

    Fortune
   

  magazine article.
  

    [15]
   

  In 1980, after promising to deliver IBM a Disk Operating System (
  
   DOS
  
  ) they had not yet developed for the
  
   Intel 8088
  
  -based
  
   IBM PC
  
  , Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a
  
   Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS)
  
  which was written by
  
   Tim Paterson
  
  who, at the time, was employed at
  
   Seattle Computer Products
  
  . As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success.
  

    [12]
   

  Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 due to serious illness.
  

    [12]
   

  Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives and still owns a reported 100 million shares.
  

    [16]
   


  Allen confirmed that he was the sole investor behind
  
   Burt Rutan
  
  's
  
   Scaled Composites
  
  '
  
   SpaceShipOne
  

   suborbital
  
  commercial spacecraft on October 4, 2004.
  

    [26]
   

  SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 377,591 feet (115,090 m) and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the
  
   Ansari X Prize
  
  competition and received the $10 million prize.
  

    [27]
   


  On December 13, 2011, Allen announced the creation of
  
   Stratolaunch Systems
  
  . Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6 engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. If successful, this project would be the first wholly privately funded space transport system.
  

    [28]
   

  Stratolaunch, which is partnering with
  
   Orbital ATK
  
  and
  
   Scaled Composites
  
  , is intended to launch in inclement weather, fly without worrying about the availability of launch pads and to operate from different locations. Stratolaunch plans to ultimately host six to ten missions per year.
  

    [29]
   

  On April 13, 2015, Vulcan Aerospace was announced. It is the company within Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc. that plans and executes projects to shift how the world conceptualizes space travel through cost reduction and on-demand access.

      SpaceShipOne can now be found at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
     
  Allen's Vulcan Real Estate division offers development and portfolio management services, and is known for the redevelopment of the
  
   South Lake Union
  
  neighborhood immediately north of downtown Seattle.
  

    [31]
   

  Vulcan has developed 6.3 million square feet (590,000 m
  
   2
  
  ) of new residential, office, retail and
  
   biotechnology
  
  research space and has a total development capacity of 10,000,000 sq ft (930,000 m
  
   2
  
  ). Vulcan advocated for the Seattle Streetcar line known as
  
   South Lake Union Streetcar
  
  , which runs from Seattle's
  
   Westlake Center
  
  to the south end of Lake Union.
  

    [32]
   

  In 2012, The
  
   Wall Street Journal
  
  called Allen's South Lake Union investment "unexpectedly lucrative" and one that led to his firm selling a 1,800,000 sq ft (170,000 m
  
   2
  
  ) office complex to
  
   Amazon.com
  
  for US$1.16 billion, one of the most expensive office deals ever in Seattle.
  

    [33]
   

  "It's exceeded my expectations," Allen said of the South Lake Union development.
 
  Allen purchased the Portland Trail Blazers NBA team in 1988 from California real estate developer
  
   Larry Weinberg
  
  for $70 million.
  

    [5]
   

  He was instrumental in the development and funding of the
  
   Moda Center
  
  (previously known as the Rose Garden), the arena where the Blazers play. He purchased the arena on April 2, 2007, and stated that this was a major milestone and a positive step for the franchise.
  

    [12]
   



    [34]
   

  Since taking over the franchise, the Allen-owned Trail Blazers have reached the playoffs 19 times including the
  
   NBA Finals
  
  in 1990 and 1992 (As of July 2015)
  

    [35]
   

  According to Forbes, the Blazers were valued at $940 million in 2015 and ranked No. 12 out of 30 NBA teams.
  

    [36]
   


  Allen purchased the Seattle Seahawks NFL team in 1996 when former owner
  
   Ken Behring
  
  threatened to move the Seahawks to Southern California.
  

    [4]
   

  Herman Sarkowsky, a former Seahawks minority owner, told
  
   The Seattle Times
  
  about Allen's decision to buy the team, "I'm not sure anybody else in this community would have done what [Allen] did."
  

    [37]
   

  The Seahawks are valued at $1.33 billion in August 2014 by
  
   Forbes
  
  , which says the team has "one of the most rabid fan bases in the NFL."
  

    [38]
   

  Under the helm of Allen, the Seahawks have been to the
  
   Super Bowl
  
  three times winning
  
   Super Bowl XLVIII
  
  and have won three NFC Championships (2005, 2013, 2014).
  

    [39]
   


  Allen's Vulcan Sports & Entertainment is part of the ownership team of the Seattle Sounders FC, a
  
   Major League Soccer
  
  (MLS) franchise that began play in 2009 at
  
   CenturyLink Field
  
  , a stadium also controlled by Allen.
  

    [6]
   

  The ownership team also includes film producer
  
   Joe Roth
  
  , businessman
  
   Adrian Hanauer
  
  , and comedian
  
   Drew Carey
  
  . The Sounders sold out every home game during its first season, setting a new MLS record for average match attendance and the most season tickets sold in the league. Seattle Sounders FC is only the second expansion team in MLS history to win the U.S. Open Cup tournament in its first season.

  Paul Allen received his first electric guitar at the age of sixteen, and was inspired to play it by listening to
  
   Jimi Hendrix
  
  .
  

    [112]
   

  In 2000, Allen played rhythm guitar on the independently-produced and eponymous album
  
   Grown Men
  
  .
  

    [113]
   

  In 2013, he had a major label release on Sony's Legacy Recordings;
  
   Everywhere at Once
  
  by Paul Allen and the Underthinkers.
  

    [114]
   

  PopMatters.com described
  
   Everywhere at Once
  
  as "a quality release of blues-rock that's enjoyable from start to finish."

  The launch of Paul Allen's 414 feet (126 m) yacht,
  

    Octopus
   

  , secured its position as one of the world's largest yachts in 2003.
  

    [117]
   

  As of 2013, it is 14th in the
  
   list of motor yachts by length
  
  . The yacht is equipped with two helicopters, a submarine, an
  
   ROV
  
  , a swimming pool, a music studio and a basketball court.
  

    [118]
   


  Allen has loaned
  
   Octopus
  
  for a number of operations. Most notably,
  
   Octopus
  
  was used in the search for a missing American pilot and two officers whose plane disappeared off
  
   Palau
  


    [119]
   

  and the study of a rare fish called a
  
   coelacanth
  
  among many others.
  

    [120]
   


  In 2012, Allen along with his research team and the
  
   Royal Navy
  
  attempted to retrieve the bell from
  
   HMS
   
    Hood
   

  , which sank in the
  
   Denmark Strait
  
  during World War II, but the attempt failed due to poor weather. On August 7, 2015, they tried again and recovered the bell in very good condition.
  

    [121]
   

  It was further restored and put on display in May 2016 in the
  
   National Museum of the Royal Navy
  
  to memorialize the 1,415 men lost at sea.
  

    [122]
   


  In March 2015, an Allen-led research team found the
  
   Japanese battleship
   
    Musashi
   

  in the
  
   Sibuyan Sea
  
  off the coast of the Philippines.
  

    [123]
   


   Musashi
  
  and her sister ship
  

    Yamato
   

  were two of the largest and most technologically impressive battleships in naval history.
 

   Octopus
  
  is a member of AMVER, a voluntary group ship reporting system used worldwide by authorities to arrange assistance for those in distress at sea.
  

    [124]
   


  The ship is also known for its annual celebrity-studded parties hosted at
  
   Cannes film festival
  
  ,
  

    [125]
   

  where Allen and his band play for guests. These performances have included musicians such as
  
   Usher
  
  and
  
   Dave Stewart
  
  .
  

    [126]
   


  Allen also owns
  
   Meduse
  
  and
  

    Tatoosh
   
   ,
  
  which is one of the world's 100 largest yachts. In January 2016, it was reported that
  
   Tatoosh
  
  allegedly damaged coral in the
  
   Cayman Islands
  
  .
  

    [127]
   

  In April 2016, the Department of Environment (DoE) and Allen's Vulcan Inc. successfully completed a restoration plan to help speed recovery and protect the future of coral in this area.

  Paul Allen has received various awards recognizing many different areas including sports, philanthropy, and the arts:
 
  In 2011, Allen's memoir
  

    Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft
   

  , was published by Portfolio, a
  
   Penguin Group
  
  imprint. The book recounts how Allen became enamored with computers at an early age, conceived the idea for Microsoft, recruited his friend Bill Gates to join him, and launched what would become the world's most successful software company. The paperback version of
  
   Idea Man
  
  , which included a new epilogue, came out on October 30, 2012.
