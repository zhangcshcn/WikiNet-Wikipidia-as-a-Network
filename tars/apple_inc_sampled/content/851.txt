   Artificial intelligence
  
  (
  
   AI
  
  ) is
  
   intelligence
  
  exhibited by
  
   machines
  
  . In
  
   computer science
  
  , the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "
  
   intelligent agents
  
  ": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.
  

    [1]
   

  Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other
  
   human minds
  
  , such as "learning" and "problem solving" (known as
  
   Machine Learning
  
  ).
  

    [2]
   

  As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For instance,
  
   optical character recognition
  
  is no longer perceived as an example of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.
  

    [3]
   

  Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully
  
   understanding human speech
  
  ,
  

    [4]
   

  competing at a high level in
  
   strategic game
  
  systems (such as
  
   Chess
  
  and
  
   Go
  


    [5]
   

  ),
  
   self-driving cars
  
  , intelligent routing in
  
   content delivery networks
  
  , and interpreting complex data.
 
  AI research is divided into subfields
  

    [6]
   

  that focus on specific
  
   problems
  
  or on specific
  
   approaches
  
  or on the use of a particular
  
   tool
  
  or towards satisfying particular
  
   applications
  
  .
 
  The central problems (or goals) of AI research include
  
   reasoning
  
  ,
  
   knowledge
  
  ,
  
   planning
  
  ,
  
   learning
  
  ,
  
   natural language processing
  
  (communication),
  
   perception
  
  and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
  

    [7]
   


   General intelligence
  
  is among the field's long-term goals.
  

    [8]
   

  Approaches include
  
   statistical methods
  
  ,
  
   computational intelligence
  
  , and
  
   traditional symbolic AI
  
  . Many tools are used in AI, including versions of
  
   search and mathematical optimization
  
  ,
  
   logic
  
  ,
  
   methods based on probability and economics
  
  . The AI field draws upon
  
   computer science
  
  ,
  
   mathematics
  
  ,
  
   psychology
  
  ,
  
   linguistics
  
  ,
  
   philosophy
  
  ,
  
   neuroscience
  
  and
  
   artificial psychology
  
  .
 
  The field was founded on the claim that
  
   human intelligence
  
  "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
  

    [9]
   

  This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the
  
   mind
  
  and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by
  
   myth
  
  ,
  
   fiction
  
  and
  
   philosophy
  
  since
  
   antiquity
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly.
  

    [11]
   

  Attempts to create artificial intelligence have experienced many
  
   setbacks
  
  , including the
  
   ALPAC report
  
  of 1966, the abandonment of
  
   perceptrons
  
  in 1970,
  
   the Lighthill Report
  
  of 1973,
  
   the second AI winter 1987–1993
  
  and the
  
   collapse of the Lisp machine market
  
  in 1987.
 
  In the twenty-first century, AI techniques, both "hard" and "soft", have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in
  
   computer power
  
  , sizes of
  
   training sets
  
  , and theoretical understanding, and AI techniques have become an essential part of the
  
   technology industry
  
  , helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science.
  

    [12]
   


  While thought-capable
  
   artificial beings
  
  appeared as
  
   storytelling devices
  
  in antiquity,
  

    [13]
   

  the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with
  
   Ramon Llull
  
  (c. 1300 CE). With his
  
   Calculus ratiocinator
  
  ,
  
   Gottfried Leibniz
  
  extended the concept of the
  
   calculating machine
  
  (
  
   Wilhelm Schickard
  
  engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers.
  

    [14]
   

  Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in
  
   Mary Shelley
  
  's
  

    Frankenstein
   

  or
  
   Karel Čapek
  
  's
  

    R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)
   

  .
  

    [15]
   


  The study of mechanical or
  
   "formal" reasoning
  
  began with
  
   philosophers
  
  and mathematicians in antiquity. In the 19th century,
  
   George Boole
  
  refined those ideas into
  
   propositional logic
  
  and
  
   Gottlob Frege
  
  developed a notational system for
  
   mechanical reasoning
  
  (a
  
   "
   
    predicate calculus
   
   "
  
  ).
  

    [16]
   

  Around the 1940s,
  
   Alan Turing
  
  's
  
   theory of computation
  
  suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the
  
   Church–Turing thesis
  
  .

   ]
  
  Along with concurrent discoveries in
  
   neurology
  
  ,
  
   information theory
  
  and
  
   cybernetics
  
  , this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.
  

    [18]
   

  The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was
  
   McCullouch
  
  and
  
   Pitts
  
  ' 1943 formal design for
  
   Turing-complete
  
  "artificial neurons".
  

    [14]
   


  The field of AI research was "born"
  

    [19]
   

  at
  
   a conference
  
  at
  
   Dartmouth College
  
  in 1956.
  

    [20]
   

  Attendees
  
   Allen Newell
  
  (
  
   CMU
  
  ),
  
   Herbert Simon
  
  (
  
   CMU
  
  ),
  
   John McCarthy
  
  (
  
   MIT
  
  ),
  
   Marvin Minsky
  
  (
  
   MIT
  
  ) and
  
   Arthur Samuel
  
  (
  
   IBM
  
  ) became the founders and leaders of AI research.
  

    [21]
   

  At the conference, Newell and Simon, together with programmer
  
   J. C. Shaw
  
  (
  
   RAND
  
  ), presented the first true artificial intelligence program, the
  
   Logic Theorist
  
  . This spurred tremendous research in the domain:
  

    [22]
   

  computers were winning at checkers, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.
  

    [23]
   

  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the
  
   Department of Defense
  


    [24]
   

  and laboratories had been established around the world.
  

    [25]
   

  AI's founders were optimistic about the future:
  
   Herbert Simon
  
  predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."
  
   Marvin Minsky
  
  agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved."
  

    [26]
   


  They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of
  
   Sir James Lighthill
  


    [27]
   

  and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "
  
   AI winter
  
  ",
  

    [28]
   

  a period when funding for AI projects was hard to find.
 
  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of
  
   expert systems
  
  ,
  

    [29]
   

  a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's
  
   fifth generation computer
  
  project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.
  

    [30]
   

  However, beginning with the collapse of the
  
   Lisp Machine
  
  market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.
  

    [31]
   


  In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics,
  
   data mining
  
  ,
  
   medical diagnosis
  
  and other areas.
  

    [12]
   

  The success was due to increasing computational power (see
  
   Moore's law
  
  ), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.

   Deep Blue
  
  became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion,
  
   Garry Kasparov
  
  on 11 May 1997.
  

    [33]
   


  Advanced statistical techniques (loosely known as
  
   deep learning
  
  ), access to
  
   large amounts of data
  
  and
  
   faster computers
  
  enabled advances in
  
   machine learning
  
  and perception.
  

    [34]
   

  By the mid 2010s, machine learning applications were used throughout the world.

  , by a significant margin.

   intelligent personal assistants
  
  in
  
   smartphones

  , becoming the first
  
   computer Go-playing system
  
  to beat a professional Go player without
  
   handicaps
  
  .

  According to
  
   Bloomberg's
  
  Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increasing from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011.
  

    [40]
   

  He attributes this to an increase in affordable
  
   neural networks
  
  , due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets. Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.
  

    [40]
   


  The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.
  

    [7]
   


  Erik Sandwell emphasizes planning and learning that is relevant and applicable to the given situation.
  

    [41]
   


  Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions (reason).
  

    [42]
   

  By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with
  
   uncertain
  
  or incomplete information, employing concepts from
  
   probability
  
  and
  
   economics
  
  .
  

    [43]
   


  For difficult problems, algorithms can require enormous computational resources—most experience a "
  
   combinatorial explosion
  
  ": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size. The search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority.
  

    [44]
   


  Human beings ordinarily use fast, intuitive judgments rather than step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.
  

    [45]
   

  AI has progressed using "sub-symbolic" problem solving:
  
   embodied agent
  
  approaches emphasize the importance of
  
   sensorimotor
  
  skills to higher reasoning;
  
   neural net
  
  research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill;
  
   statistical approaches to AI
  
  mimic the human ability.
 

   Knowledge representation
  


    [46]
   

  and
  
   knowledge engineering
  


    [47]
   

  are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;
  

    [48]
   

  situations, events, states and time;
  

    [49]
   

  causes and effects;
  

    [50]
   

  knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);
  

    [51]
   

  and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of "what exists" is an
  
   ontology
  
  : the set of objects, relations, concepts and so on that the machine knows about. The most general are called
  
   upper ontologies
  
  , which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge.
  

    [52]
   


  Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:
 
  Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.
  

    [59]
   

  They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the
  
   utility
  
  (or "value") of the available choices.
  

    [60]
   


  In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.
  

    [61]
   

  However, if the agent is not the only actor, it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.
  

    [62]
   



   Multi-agent planning
  
  uses the
  
   cooperation
  
  and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal.
  
   Emergent behavior
  
  such as this is used by
  
   evolutionary algorithms
  
  and
  
   swarm intelligence
  
  .
  

    [63]
   


  Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
  

    [64]
   



    [65]
   

  and has been central to AI research since the field's inception.
  

    [66]
   



   Unsupervised learning
  
  is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input.
  
   Supervised learning
  
  includes both
  
   classification
  
  and numerical
  
   regression
  
  . Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In
  
   reinforcement learning
  


    [67]
   

  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of
  
   decision theory
  
  , using concepts like
  
   utility
  
  . The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of
  
   theoretical computer science
  
  known as
  
   computational learning theory
  
  .
  

    [68]
   


  Within
  
   developmental robotics
  
  , developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition of repertoires of novel skills by a robot, through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers, and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   



    [71]
   



    [72]
   



   Natural language processing
  


    [73]
   

  gives machines the ability to read and
  
   understand
  
  the languages that humans speak. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable
  
   natural language user interfaces
  
  and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include
  
   information retrieval
  
  ,
  
   text mining
  
  ,
  
   question answering
  


    [74]
   

  and
  
   machine translation
  
  .
  

    [75]
   


  A common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing. Increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the user's input much more efficient.
 

   Machine perception
  


    [76]
   

  is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones,
  
   tactile sensors
  
  , sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world.
  
   Computer vision
  


    [77]
   

  is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are
  
   speech recognition
  
  ,
  

    [78]
   


   facial recognition
  
  and
  
   object recognition
  
  .
  

    [79]
   


  The field of
  
   robotics
  


    [80]
   

  is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation
  

    [81]
   

  and
  
   navigation
  
  , with sub-problems of
  
   localization
  
  (knowing where you are, or finding out where other things are),
  
   mapping
  
  (learning what is around you, building a map of the environment), and
  
   motion planning
  
  (figuring out how to get there) or path planning (going from one point in space to another point, which may involve compliant motion – where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object).
  

    [82]
   



    [83]
   


  Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human
  
   affects
  
  .
  

    [85]
   



    [86]
   

  It is an interdisciplinary field spanning
  
   computer sciences
  
  ,
  
   psychology
  
  , and
  
   cognitive science
  
  .
  

    [87]
   

  While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into
  
   emotion
  
  ,
  

    [88]
   

  the more modern branch of computer science originated with
  
   Rosalind Picard
  
  's 1995 paper
  

    [89]
   

  on affective computing.
  

    [90]
   



    [91]
   

  A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate
  
   empathy
  
  . The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them, giving an appropriate response for those emotions.
 
  Emotion and social skills
  

    [92]
   

  play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of
  
   game theory
  
  ,
  
   decision theory
  
  , as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, in an effort to facilitate
  
   human-computer interaction
  
  , an intelligent machine might want to be able to
  
   display
  
  emotions—even if it does not actually experience them itself—in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.
 
  A sub-field of AI addresses
  
   creativity
  
  both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). Related areas of computational research are
  
   Artificial intuition
  
  and Artificial thinking.
 
  Many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with
  
   artificial general intelligence
  
  , combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.
  

    [8]
   



    [93]
   

  A few believe that
  
   anthropomorphic
  
  features like
  
   artificial consciousness
  
  or an
  
   artificial brain
  
  may be required for such a project.
  

    [94]
   



    [95]
   


  Many of the problems above may require general intelligence to be considered solved. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like
  
   machine translation
  
  requires that the machine read and write in both languages (
  
   NLP
  
  ), follow the author's argument (
  
   reason
  
  ), know what is being talked about (
  
   knowledge
  
  ), and faithfully reproduce the author's intention (
  
   social intelligence
  
  ). A problem like
  
   machine translation
  
  is considered "
  
   AI-complete
  
  ". In order to reach human-level performance for machines, one must solve all the problems.
  

    [96]
   


  There is no established unifying theory or
  
   paradigm
  
  that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.
  

    [97]
   

  A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying
  
   psychology
  
  or
  
   neurology
  
  ? Or is
  
   human biology
  
  as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to
  
   aeronautical engineering
  
  ?
  

    [98]
   

  Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as
  
   logic
  
  or
  
   optimization
  
  )? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?
  

    [99]
   

  Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require "sub-symbolic" processing?
  

    [100]
   

  John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as
  
   synthetic intelligence
  
  ,
  

    [101]
   

  a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.
  

    [102]
   



    [103]
   


  Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three approaches, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior.
  

    [104]
   

  Computational philosophy, is used to develop an adaptive, free-flowing computer mind.
  

    [104]
   

  Implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish.
  

    [104]
   

  Together, the humanesque behavior, mind, and actions make up artificial intelligence.
 
  In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between
  
   neurology
  
  ,
  
   information theory
  
  , and
  
   cybernetics
  
  . Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as
  
   W. Grey Walter
  
  's
  
   turtles
  
  and the
  
   Johns Hopkins Beast
  
  . Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at
  
   Princeton University
  
  and the
  
   Ratio Club
  
  in England.
  

    [18]
   

  By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.
 
  When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions:
  
   Carnegie Mellon University
  
  ,
  
   Stanford
  
  and
  
   MIT
  
  , and each one developed its own style of research.
  
   John Haugeland
  
  named these approaches to AI "good old fashioned AI" or "
  
   GOFAI
  
  ".
  

    [105]
   

  During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on
  
   cybernetics
  
  or
  
   neural networks
  
  were abandoned or pushed into the background.
  

    [106]
   

  Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with
  
   artificial general intelligence
  
  and considered this the goal of their field.
 
  By the 1980s progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially
  
   perception
  
  ,
  
   robotics
  
  ,
  
   learning
  
  and
  
   pattern recognition
  
  . A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.
  

    [100]
   

  Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.
 
  In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly
  
   scientific
  
  , in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like
  
   mathematics
  
  , economics or
  
   operations research
  
  ).
  
   Stuart Russell
  
  and
  
   Peter Norvig
  
  describe this movement as nothing less than a "revolution" and "the victory of the
  
   neats
  
  ".
  

    [32]
   

  Critics argue that these techniques (with few exceptions
  

    [117]
   

  ) are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence.
  

    [118]
   

  There is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in AI, exemplified in part by exchanges between
  
   Peter Norvig
  
  and
  
   Noam Chomsky
  
  .
  

    [119]
   



    [120]
   


  In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in
  
   computer science
  
  . A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.
 
  Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:
  

    [124]
   


   Reasoning
  
  can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from
  
   premises
  
  to
  
   conclusions
  
  , where each step is the application of an
  
   inference rule
  
  .
  

    [125]
   


   Planning
  
  algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called
  
   means-ends analysis
  
  .
  

    [126]
   


   Robotics
  
  algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use
  
   local searches
  
  in
  
   configuration space
  
  .
  

    [81]
   

  Many
  
   learning
  
  algorithms use search algorithms based on
  
   optimization
  
  .
 
  Simple exhaustive searches
  

    [127]
   

  are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the
  
   search space
  
  (the number of places to search) quickly grows to
  
   astronomical numbers
  
  . The result is a search that is
  
   too slow
  
  or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "
  
   heuristics
  
  " or "rules of thumb" that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called "
  
   pruning
  
  the
  
   search tree
  
  ").
  
   Heuristics
  
  supply the program with a "best guess" for the path on which the solution lies.
  

    [128]
   

  Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.
  

    [82]
   


  A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of
  
   optimization
  
  . For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind
  
   hill climbing
  
  : we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are
  
   simulated annealing
  
  ,
  
   beam search
  
  and
  
   random optimization
  
  .
  

    [129]
   



   Evolutionary computation
  
  uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine,
  
   selecting
  
  only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of
  
   evolutionary computation
  
  include
  
   swarm intelligence
  
  algorithms (such as
  
   ant colony
  
  or
  
   particle swarm optimization
  
  )
  

    [130]
   

  and
  
   evolutionary algorithms
  
  (such as
  
   genetic algorithms
  
  ,
  
   gene expression programming
  
  , and
  
   genetic programming
  
  ).
  

    [131]
   



   Logic
  


    [132]
   

  is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the
  
   satplan
  
  algorithm uses logic for
  
   planning
  


    [133]
   

  and
  
   inductive logic programming
  
  is a method for
  
   learning
  
  .
  

    [134]
   


  Several different forms of logic are used in AI research.
  
   Propositional
  
  or
  
   sentential logic
  


    [135]
   

  is the logic of statements which can be true or false.
  
   First-order logic
  


    [136]
   

  also allows the use of
  
   quantifiers
  
  and
  
   predicates
  
  , and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other.
  
   Fuzzy logic
  
  ,
  

    [137]
   

  is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0).
  
   Fuzzy systems
  
  can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer
  
   product control systems
  
  .
  
   Subjective logic
  


    [138]
   

  models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a
  
   Beta distribution
  
  . By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.
 

   Default logics
  
  ,
  
   non-monotonic logics
  
  and
  
   circumscription
  


    [54]
   

  are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the
  
   qualification problem
  
  . Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of
  
   knowledge
  
  , such as:
  
   description logics
  
  ;
  

    [48]
   


   situation calculus
  
  ,
  
   event calculus
  
  and
  
   fluent calculus
  
  (for representing events and time);
  

    [49]
   


   causal calculus
  
  ;
  

    [50]
   

  belief calculus;
  

    [139]
   

  and
  
   modal logics
  
  .
  

    [51]
   


  Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from
  
   probability
  
  theory and economics.
  

    [140]
   



   Bayesian networks
  


    [141]
   

  are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the
  
   Bayesian inference
  
  algorithm),
  

    [142]
   


   learning
  
  (using the
  
   expectation-maximization algorithm
  
  ),
  

    [143]
   


   planning
  
  (using
  
   decision networks
  
  )
  

    [144]
   

  and
  
   perception
  
  (using
  
   dynamic Bayesian networks
  
  ).
  

    [145]
   

  Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping
  
   perception
  
  systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g.,
  
   hidden Markov models
  
  or
  
   Kalman filters
  
  ).
  

    [145]
   


  A key concept from the science of economics is "
  
   utility
  
  ": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using
  
   decision theory
  
  ,
  
   decision analysis
  
  ,
  

    [146]
   

  and
  
   information value theory
  
  .
  

    [60]
   

  These tools include models such as
  
   Markov decision processes
  
  ,
  

    [147]
   

  dynamic
  
   decision networks
  
  ,
  

    [145]
   


   game theory
  
  and
  
   mechanism design
  
  .
  

    [148]
   


  The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems.
  
   Classifiers
  
  are functions that use
  
   pattern matching
  
  to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.
  

    [149]
   


  A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and
  
   machine learning
  
  approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the
  
   neural network
  
  ,
  

    [150]
   


   kernel methods
  
  such as the
  
   support vector machine
  
  ,
  

    [151]
   


   k-nearest neighbor algorithm
  
  ,
  

    [152]
   


   Gaussian mixture model
  
  ,
  

    [153]
   


   naive Bayes classifier
  
  ,
  

    [154]
   

  and
  
   decision tree
  
  .
  

    [155]
   

  The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the "
  
   no free lunch
  
  " theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.
  

    [156]
   


  The study of non-learning
  
   artificial neural networks
  


    [150]
   

  began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of
  
   Walter Pitts
  
  and
  
   Warren McCullouch
  
  .
  
   Frank Rosenblatt
  
  invented the
  
   perceptron
  
  , a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of
  
   linear regression
  
  . Early pioneers also include
  
   Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko
  
  ,
  
   Teuvo Kohonen
  
  ,
  
   Stephen Grossberg
  
  ,
  
   Kunihiko Fukushima
  
  , Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw,
  
   Shun-Ichi Amari
  
  ,
  
   Bernard Widrow
  
  ,
  
   John Hopfield
  
  ,
  
   Eduardo R. Caianiello
  
  , and others.
 
  The main categories of networks are acyclic or
  
   feedforward neural networks
  
  (where the signal passes in only one direction) and
  
   recurrent neural networks
  
  (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are
  
   perceptrons
  
  ,
  
   multi-layer perceptrons
  
  and
  
   radial basis networks
  
  .
  

    [157]
   

  Neural networks can be applied to the problem of
  
   intelligent control
  
  (for robotics) or
  
   learning
  
  , using such techniques as
  
   Hebbian learning
  
  ,
  
   GMDH
  
  or
  
   competitive learning
  
  .
  

    [158]
   


  Today, neural networks are often trained by the
  
   backpropagation
  
  algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of
  
   automatic differentiation
  
  published by
  
   Seppo Linnainmaa
  
  ,
  

    [159]
   



    [160]
   

  and was introduced to neural networks by
  
   Paul Werbos
  
  .
  

    [161]
   



    [162]
   



    [163]
   



   Hierarchical temporal memory
  
  is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the
  
   neocortex
  
  .
  

    [164]
   



   Deep learning
  
  in
  
   artificial neural networks
  
  with many layers has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including
  
   computer vision
  
  ,
  
   speech recognition
  
  ,
  
   natural language processing
  
  and others.
  

    [165]
   



    [166]
   



    [167]
   


  According to a survey,
  

    [168]
   

  the expression "Deep Learning" was introduced to the
  
   Machine Learning
  
  community by
  
   Rina Dechter
  
  in 1986
  

    [169]
   

  and gained traction after Igor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to
  
   Artificial Neural Networks
  
  in 2000.
  

    [170]
   

  The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by
  
   Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko
  
  and V. G. Lapa in 1965.
  

    [171]
   


   [

   ]
  
  These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper
  

    [172]
   

  describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by
  
   Geoffrey Hinton
  
  and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered
  
   feedforward neural networks
  
  (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an
  
   unsupervised
  

   restricted Boltzmann machine
  
  , then using
  
   supervised
  

   backpropagation
  
  for fine-tuning.
  

    [173]
   

  Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.
  

    [174]
   


  Deep learning often uses
  
   convolutional neural networks
  
  (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the
  
   Neocognitron
  
  introduced by
  
   Kunihiko Fukushima
  
  in 1980.
  

    [175]
   

  In 1989,
  
   Yann LeCun
  
  and colleagues applied
  
   backpropagation
  
  to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.
  

    [176]
   

  Since 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have won many visual pattern recognition competitions.
  

    [167]
   


  Deep feedforward neural networks were used in conjunction with
  
   reinforcement learning
  
  by
  
   AlphaGo
  
  , Google Deepmind's program that was the first to beat a professional human player.
  

    [177]
   


  Early on,
  
   deep learning
  
  was also applied to sequence learning with
  
   recurrent neural networks
  
  (RNNs)
  

    [178]
   

  which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence.
  

    [167]
   

  RNNs can be trained by
  
   gradient descent
  


    [179]
   



    [180]
   



    [181]
   

  but suffer from the
  
   vanishing gradient problem
  
  .
  

    [165]
   



    [182]
   

  In 1992, it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of
  
   recurrent neural networks
  
  can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems.
  

    [183]
   


  Numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the
  
   long short-term memory
  
  (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997.
  

    [184]
   

  LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC).
  

    [185]
   

  At Google, Microsoft and Baidu this approach has revolutionised
  
   speech recognition
  
  .
  

    [186]
   



    [187]
   



    [188]
   

  For example, in 2015, Google's speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through
  
   Google Voice
  
  to billions of smartphone users.
  

    [189]
   

  Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation,
  

    [190]
   

  Language Modeling
  

    [191]
   

  and Multilingual Language Processing.
  

    [192]
   

  LSTM combined with CNNs also improved automatic image captioning
  

    [193]
   

  and a plethora of other applications.
 

   Control theory
  
  , the grandchild of
  
   cybernetics
  
  , has many important applications, especially in
  
   robotics
  
  .
  

    [194]
   


  AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including
  
   Lisp
  


    [195]
   

  and
  
   Prolog
  
  .
  

    [196]
   


  In 1950,
  
   Alan Turing
  
  proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the
  
   Turing test
  
  . This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.
  

    [197]
   


  Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed
  
   subject matter expert Turing tests
  
  . Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.
  

    [198]
   


  For example, performance at
  
   draughts
  
  (i.e. checkers) is optimal,
  

    [199]
   

  performance at chess is high-human and nearing super-human (see
  
   computer chess: computers versus human
  
  ) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.
 
  A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from
  
   mathematical
  
  definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from
  
   Kolmogorov complexity
  
  and
  
   data compression
  
  .
  

    [200]
   

  Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.
 
  A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (
  
   CAPTCHA
  
  ). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.

  AI is relevant to any intellectual task.
  

    [202]
   

  Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the
  
   AI effect
  
  .
  

    [203]
   


  High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as
  
   drones
  
  and
  
   self-driving cars
  
  ), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as
  
   Google search
  
  ), online assistants (such as
  
   Siri
  
  ), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions
  

    [204]
   

  and targeting online advertisements.

  With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,
  

    [207]
   

  major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.
  

    [208]
   


  There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining,
  
   robotic cars
  
  , robot soccer and games.
 
  Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.
  

    [209]
   

  There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are way too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting
  
   myeloid leukemia
  
  , a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers.
  

    [210]
   

  Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.
  

    [211]
   


  According to
  
   CNN
  
  , there was a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington which successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed.
  

    [212]
   


  Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of
  
   driverless cars
  
  . A few companies involved with AI include
  
   Tesla
  
  ,
  
   Google
  
  , and
  
   Apple
  
  .
  

    [213]
   


  Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle.
  

    [214]
   


  One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less car to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.
  

    [215]
   

  Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.

   Financial institutions
  
  have long used
  
   artificial neural network
  
  systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation.
 
  Use of AI in banking can be tracked back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in USA set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards. Apps like Kasisito and Moneystream are using AI in financial services
 
  Banks use artificial intelligence systems to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.
  

    [217]
   

  In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated
  
   financial trading
  
  competition.
  

    [218]
   


  AI has also reduced fraud and crime by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any changes or anomalies.
  

    [219]
   


  A
  
   platform
  
  (or "
  
   computing platform
  
  ") is defined as "some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run". As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago,
  

    [220]
   

  it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.
 
  A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from
  
   expert systems
  
  such as
  
   Cyc
  
  to
  
   deep-learning frameworks
  
  to robot platforms such as the
  
   Roomba
  
  with open interface.
  

    [221]
   

  Recent advances in deep
  
   artificial neural networks
  
  and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries, including
  
   Deeplearning4j
  
  ,
  
   TensorFlow
  
  ,
  
   Theano
  
  and
  
   Torch
  
  .
 
  Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have established a non-profit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies, advance the public's understanding, and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence.
  

    [222]
   

  They stated: "This partnership on AI will conduct research, organize discussions, provide thought leadership, consult with relevant third parties, respond to questions from the public and media, and create educational material that advance the understanding of AI technologies including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning."
  

    [222]
   

  Apple joined other tech companies as a founding member of the Partnership on AI in January 2017. The corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group, while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board.
  

    [223]
   


  There are three philosophical questions related to AI:
 
  Can a machine be intelligent? Can it "think"?
 
  Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the
  
   Future of Life Institute
  
  , among others, described some short-term research goals to be how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.
  

    [233]
   


  Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. Research in this area includes "machine ethics", "artificial moral agents", and the study of "malevolent vs. friendly AI".
 
   The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded.
  
  A common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to mankind. This concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including
  
   Stephen Hawking
  
  ,
  
   Bill Gates
  
  ,
  

    [235]
   

  and
  
   Elon Musk
  
  .
  

    [236]
   

  A group of prominent tech titans including
  
   Peter Thiel
  
  , Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1billion to
  
   OpenAI
  
  a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development.
  

    [237]
   

  The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.
  

    [238]
   


  In his book
  

    Superintelligence
   

  ,
  
   Nick Bostrom
  
  provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit
  
   convergent
  
  behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.
 
  For this danger to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.
  

    [239]
   



    [240]
   

  Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.
  

    [241]
   


  Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. In January 2015,
  
   Elon Musk
  
  donated ten million dollars to the
  
   Future of Life Institute
  
  to fund research on understanding AI decision making. The goal of the institute is to "grow wisdom with which we manage" the growing power of technology. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as
  
   Google DeepMind
  
  and
  
   Vicarious
  
  to "just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence.
  

    [242]
   

  I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there."
  

    [243]
   



    [244]
   


  Development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern. Currently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers.
  

    [245]
   



   Joseph Weizenbaum
  
  wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as
  
   customer service
  
  or
  
   psychotherapy
  


    [246]
   

  was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as
  
   computationalism
  
  ). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.

  Martin Ford, author of
  
   The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future
  
  ,
  

    [248]
   

  and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning
  

    [249]
   

  and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to
  
   outsource
  

   knowledge work
  
  .

  This raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other AI agents. This issue was addressed by Wendell Wallach in his book titled
  
   Moral Machines
  
  in which he introduced the concept of
  
   artificial moral agents
  
  (AMA).
  

    [251]
   

  For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as "Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions"
  

    [252]
   

  and "Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral".
  

    [253]
   

  For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of
  
   whether
  
  machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the
  
   constraints
  
  which society may place on the development of AMAs.
  

    [254]
   


  The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.
  

    [255]
   

  The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics."
  

    [256]
   

  Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition "Machine Ethics"
  

    [255]
   

  that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.
  

    [256]
   


  Political scientist
  
   Charles T. Rubin
  
  believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.
  

    [257]
   

  He argues that "any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence." Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably, because there is no
  
   a priori
  
  reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.
 
  Physicist
  
   Stephen Hawking
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft
  
  founder
  
   Bill Gates
  
  and
  
   SpaceX
  
  founder
  
   Elon Musk
  
  have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could "
  
   spell the end of the human race
  
  ".
  

    [258]
   


  One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '
  
   Friendly AI
  
  ', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.
 
  Leading AI researcher
  
   Rodney Brooks
  
  writes, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."
  

    [259]
   


  If an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be
  
   sentient
  
  – will it have a
  
   mind
  
  which has
  
   conscious experiences
  
  ? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the
  
   hard problem of consciousness
  
  .
 
  Computationalism is the position in the
  
   philosophy of mind
  
  that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.
  

    [260]
   

  Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the
  
   mind-body problem
  
  . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers
  
   Jerry Fodor
  
  and
  
   Hilary Putnam
  
  .
 
  The philosophical position that John Searle has named
  
   "strong AI"
  
  states: "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."
  

    [261]
   

  Searle counters this assertion with his
  
   Chinese room
  
  argument, which asks us to look
  
   inside
  
  the computer and try to find where the "mind" might be.
  

    [262]
   



   Mary Shelley
  
  's
  

    Frankenstein
   

  considers a key issue in the
  
   ethics of artificial intelligence
  
  : if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also
  

    feel
   

  ? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film
  

    A.I.: Artificial Intelligence
   

  , in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This issue, now known as "
  
   robot rights
  
  ", is currently being considered by, for example, California's
  
   Institute for the Future
  
  , although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.
  

    [263]
   

  The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film
  

    Plug & Pray
   

  .
  

    [264]
   


  Are there limits to how intelligent machines – or human-machine hybrids – can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ‘’Superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.
  

    [93]
   


  If research into
  
   Strong AI
  
  produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to
  
   recursive self-improvement
  
  .
  

    [265]
   

  The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer
  
   Vernor Vinge
  
  named this scenario "
  
   singularity
  
  ".
  

    [266]
   

  Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.
  

    [266]
   



    [93]
   



   Ray Kurzweil
  
  has used
  
   Moore's law
  
  (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that
  
   desktop computers
  
  will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.
  

    [266]
   


   You awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning. Invisible, this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory, suggests plausible courses of action, and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts. You quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works. You just use it. This is the dream of artificial intelligence.
  
  Robot designer
  
   Hans Moravec
  
  , cyberneticist
  
   Kevin Warwick
  
  and inventor
  
   Ray Kurzweil
  
  have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into
  
   cyborgs
  
  that are more capable and powerful than either.
  

    [268]
   

  This idea, called
  
   transhumanism
  
  , which has roots in
  
   Aldous Huxley
  
  and
  
   Robert Ettinger
  
  , has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the
  
   manga
  


    Ghost in the Shell
   

  and the science-fiction series
  

    Dune
   

  .
 
  In the 1980s artist
  
   Hajime Sorayama
  
  's Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later "the Gynoids" book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including
  
   George Lucas
  
  and other creatives. Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.
 

   Edward Fredkin
  
  argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by
  
   Samuel Butler
  
  's "
  
   Darwin among the Machines
  
  " (1863), and expanded upon by
  
   George Dyson
  
  in his book of the same name in 1998.
  

    [269]
   


  Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity.
  

    [13]
   


  The implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in
  
   science fiction
  
  since the twentieth century. Early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots. The word "robot" itself was coined by
  
   Karel Čapek
  
  in his 1921 play
  

    R.U.R.
   

  , the title standing for "
  
   Rossum's Universal Robots
  
  ". Later, the SF writer
  
   Isaac Asimov
  
  developed the
  
   Three Laws of Robotics
  
  which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories. Asimov's laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics;
  

    [270]
   

  while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.
  

    [271]
   


  The novel
  

    Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
   

  , by
  
   Philip K. Dick
  
  , tells a science fiction story about Androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world. Elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box, mood organ, and the androids themselves. Throughout the novel, Dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.
  

    [272]
   


  Nowadays AI is firmly rooted in popular culture; intelligent robots appear in innumerable works.
  
   HAL
  
  , the murderous computer in charge of the spaceship in
  

    2001: A Space Odyssey
   

  (1968), is an example of the common "robotic rampage" archetype in science fiction movies.
  

    The Terminator
   

  (1984) and
  

    The Matrix
   

  (1999) provide additional widely familiar examples. In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from
  

    The Day the Earth Stood Still
   

  (1951) and Bishop from
  

    Aliens
   

  (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.
