  ) (version 10.10) is the eleventh
  
   major release
  
  of
  
   OS X (now named macOS)
  
  ,
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  's desktop and
  
   server
  
  operating system for
  
   Macintosh
  
  computers.
 
  OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on June 2, 2014 at
  
   WWDC 2014
  
  and released to public beta testers on July 24, 2014. Yosemite was released to consumers on October 16, 2014.
  

    [3]
   

  Following the
  
   California
  
  landmark-based naming scheme introduced with
  
   OS X Mavericks
  
  , Yosemite is named after the
  
   national park
  
  .
 


  All Macintosh products capable of running
  
   OS X Mountain Lion
  
  (v10.8.x) are able to run Yosemite as they have the same requirements.
  

    [4]
   

  However, in order to take full advantage of the
  
   Handoff
  
  feature, additional minimum system requirements include a Mac with
  
   Bluetooth LE
  
  (Bluetooth 4.0). As with Mavericks and Mountain Lion, 2
  

  GB of RAM, 8
  

  GB of available storage, and OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later are required.
 
  These are the models that are compatible with OS X Yosemite (with exceptions):
 
  These are the models that support new features such as Handoff, Instant Hotspot as well as
  
   AirDrop
  
  between Mac computers and
  
   iOS devices
  
  :
  

    [5]
   


  Yosemite introduced a major overhaul of OS X's
  
   user interface
  
  . Its graphics replaced
  
   skeuomorphism
  
  with
  
   flat graphic design
  
  and blurred translucency effects, following the aesthetic introduced with
  
   iOS 7
  
  . Some icons have been changed to correspond with those of iOS 7 and
  
   iOS 8
  
  . Yosemite maintains the
  
   OS X
  

   desktop metaphor
  
  .
  

    [6]
   


  Other design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes, and the replacement of
  
   Lucida Grande
  
  with
  
   Helvetica Neue
  
  as the default system typeface.
  

    [7]
   



    [8]
   



    [9]
   

  The
  
   Dock
  
  is now a 2D translucent rectangle instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design used in early versions of OS X through
  
   Tiger
  
  and in iOS since iOS 7.
 
  Many of Yosemite's new features focus on the theme of continuity, increasing its integration with other Apple services and platforms such as
  
   iOS
  
  and
  
   iCloud
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  The Handoff functionality allows the operating system to integrate with
  
   iOS 8
  
  devices over
  
   Bluetooth LE
  
  and
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  ; users can place and answer phone calls using their
  
   iPhone
  
  as a conduit, send and receive
  
   text messages
  
  , activate
  
   personal hotspots
  
  , or load items being worked on in a
  
   mobile app
  
  (such as
  
   Mail
  
  drafts or
  
   Numbers
  

   spreadsheets
  
  ) directly into their desktop equivalent.
  

    [10]
   



   Notification Center
  
  features a new "Today" view, similar to that in
  
   iOS
  
  . The Today view can display information and updates from various sources, along with
  
   widgets
  
  .
  

    [7]
   



    [8]
   

  The widgets in the Today view are similar to those of
  
   iOS 8
  
  .
 
  As of OS X 10.10.3,
  
   Photos
  
  replaces
  
   iPhoto
  
  and
  
   Aperture
  
  . It uses iCloud Photo Library to upload all the user's photos across their devices.
 

   Spotlight
  
  is a more prominent part of the operating system; it now displays its search box in the center of the screen and can include results from online sources, including
  
   Bing
  
  ,
  
   Maps
  
  , and
  
   Wikipedia
  
  .
  

    [7]
   

  Stock applications such as
  
   Safari
  
  and
  
   Mail
  
  have been updated.
  

    [11]
   

  In particular, many security features have been added to Safari, such as a custom history clearing option that lets users clear history, cookies, and other data from the previous hour, day, or two days. In addition, Apple added
  
   DuckDuckGo
  
  to its search offerings, a non-tracking search engine that doesn’t store users’ data.
  

    [12]
   

  Safari allows you to remotely close tabs from an iOS device.
  

    [13]
   


   Safari
  
  now supports browsing in private browsing mode with certain windows (as opposed to all the windows having to be either in or out of private browsing).
  

    [14]
   


  The green "zoom" button on windows now has a different function in applications that support full screen mode. Instead of simply enlarging the window, the button now enters full screen mode, eliminating the full screen button at the top right corner of windows that has been present since
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  . However, holding the
  
   Option key
  
  (⌥) while clicking the zoom button or double-clicking on the window chrome continues to invoke the original behavior.
  

    [15]
   


   :123–124
  

  JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is the new system-wide support for scripting with
  
   JavaScript
  
  , built upon
  
   JavaScriptCore
  
  and the
  
   Open Scripting Architecture
  
  .
  

    [16]
   

  It features an
  
   Objective-C
  
  bridge which enables entire
  
   Cocoa
  
  applications to be programmed in JavaScript.
  

    [17]
   


  Along with other framework changes,
  
   CloudKit
  
  was integrated in this release.
  

    [18]
   

  CloudKit functions as a
  
   Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)
  
  and is one method for
  
   App
  
  developers to integrate access to Apple’s iCloud
  
   servers
  
  into their apps.
  

    [19]
   


  There is a "dark mode" in
  
   System Preferences
  
  which makes the dock and menu bar darker.
  

    [13]
   


  Apple initiated a new public beta program for OS X, a practice not seen with its operating systems since 2000's
  
   US$29.95
  

   Mac OS X Public Beta
  
  , which had preceded the release of
  
   Mac OS X v10.0
  
  . Yosemite is part of the OS X Beta Seed Program, a public program that allows the first 1 million
  

    [20]
   

  users to download and test the Yosemite beta at no charge. Beta testers are required to acknowledge the potential risks involved with prerelease software, and sign a
  
   non-disclosure agreement
  
  (NDA).
  

    [21]
   

  The program began releasing Public Betas on July 24, 2014.
  

    [22]
   

  Six public betas of Yosemite were released.
 

      OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 Combo update
     


     This release unified the previously forked build for the early 2015 MacBook Air

  On release, Yosemite received generally positive reviews, with users praising the simplified user interface. Programmer John Siracusa, who had reviewed every OS release, wrote for
  
   Ars Technica
  
  that "Yosemite is an aesthetic one-way valve... switching back to
  
   Mavericks
  
  after a week or two in Yosemite is like returning to
  
   iOS 6
  
  . Everything looks embarrassingly chunky, glossy, and gaudy."
  

    [23]
   

  Macworld's review generally praised Yosemite for its design, but noted that it had found WiFi network issues and that Continuity had proved unreliable.
  

    [24]
   

  While many reviews in the press praised the new design aesthetic, users were often left baffled with these statements

  . Widespread disagreement and contention could be found in the comment sections of articles discussing the design of the revamped interface

  . While some praised the changes as new and fresh, others complained about flattened, hard to distinguish buttons reducing usability

  . Other critiques concluded the new look to be generally ugly, bright, overly saturated, childlike, or comparing the aesthetic to 'Fisher-Price'

  As Yosemite entered general release and stability/performance problems on the initial release did not seem to have been resolved, an ongoing discussion began to develop among prominent developers and webloggers about Apple software quality and stability. (This issue may not have been noticed earlier since many initial-release reviewers review from betas, which are expected to contain some bugs, and therefore tend to focus on features rather than stability unless stability is still completely unacceptable at release date; wider use may also highlight some more obscure bugs.)
 
  Yosemite faced particular problems with network stability and the
  
   discoveryd
  
  DNS system. Because of this, Apple reverted
  
   discoveryd
  
  back to the
  
   mDNSResponder
  
  system (used in Mavericks) in 10.10.4.
  

    [25]
   

  Another notable bug experienced on Yosemite was the 'unicode of death' problem, following a similar bug in 2013, in which a meaningless Arabic text string could crash applications using the system text-display APIs.
  

    [26]
   

  Some users that upgraded to Yosemite complained that the Finder fails to show the contents of folders.
  

    [27]
   


  Software developers and users have argued that Apple's yearly release schedule and development practices have compromised stability, and meant that no version of OS X is truly recommendable for users requiring reliability above new user interface design and features.

  Spotlight on Yosemite by default reports the user's current location (at the city level) and all their search queries to Apple and third parties.

    [37]
   

  Reporting by Spotlight can be disabled by the user, although, even if this is done, the
  
   Safari
  

   web browser
  
  will continue to send search terms to Apple unless the function is separately disabled.
