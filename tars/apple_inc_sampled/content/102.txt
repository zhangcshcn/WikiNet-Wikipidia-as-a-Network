  Apple was founded by
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  ,
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  , and
  
   Ronald Wayne
  
  in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers.
  

    [6]
   

  It was incorporated as
  
   Apple Computer, Inc.
  
  in January 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. in January 2007 to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics. Apple (
  
   NASDAQ
  
  :
  
   AAPL
  
  ) joined the
  
   Dow Jones Industrial Average
  
  in March 2015.
  

    [7]
   


  Apple is the
  
   world's largest information technology company
  
  by revenue, the world's largest technology company by
  
   total assets
  
  ,
  

    [8]
   

  and the
  
   world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer
  
  , by volume, after
  
   Samsung
  
  .
  

    [9]
   

  In November 2014, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over
  
   US$
  
  700
  

  billion in addition to being the
  
   largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  The company employs 115,000 full-time employees as of July 2015
  

    [update]
   



    [4]
   

  and maintains 478
  
   retail stores
  
  in seventeen countries as of March 2016
  

    [update]
   

  .
  

    [1]
   

  It operates the
  
   online Apple Store
  
  and iTunes Store, the latter of which is the world's largest music retailer. Consumers use more than one billion Apple products worldwide as of March 2016
  

    [update]
   

  .
  

    [11]
   


  Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $233
  

  billion for the
  
   fiscal year
  
  ending in September 2015.
  

    [3]
   

  This revenue accounts for approximately 1.25% of the total
  
   United States GDP
  
  .
  

    [12]
   

  The company enjoys a high level of
  
   brand loyalty
  
  and, according to
  
   Interbrand
  
  's annual Best Global Brands report, has been the world's most valuable brand for 4 years in a row,
  

    [13]
   



    [14]
   



    [15]
   

  with a valuation in 2016 of $178.1
  

  billion.
  

    [16]
   

  The corporation
  
   receives significant criticism
  
  regarding the labor practices of its contractors and its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.
 


  Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  ,
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  and
  
   Ronald Wayne
  


    [17]
   



    [18]
   

  to sell the
  
   Apple I
  
  personal computer kit. The
  
   Apple I
  
  kits were computers single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   

  and first shown to the public at the
  
   Homebrew Computer Club
  
  .
  

    [21]
   

  The Apple I was sold as a
  
   motherboard
  
  (with
  
   CPU
  
  ,
  
   RAM
  
  , and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer.
  

    [22]
   

  The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,806 in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation).
  

    [23]
   



    [24]
   



    [25]
   



    [26]
   



    [27]
   



    [28]
   


  Apple was incorporated January 3, 1977,
  

    [29]
   

  without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800.
  

    [18]
   

  Multimillionaire
  
   Mike Markkula
  
  provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.
  

    [30]
   



    [31]
   

  During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118m, an average annual growth rate of 533%.
  

    [32]
   


  The
  
   Apple II
  
  , also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first
  
   West Coast Computer Faire
  
  . It differed from its major rivals, the
  
   TRS-80
  
  and
  
   Commodore PET
  
  , because of its character cell-based color graphics and
  
   open architecture
  
  . While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch
  
   floppy disk
  
  drive and interface called the
  
   Disk II
  
  .
  

    [33]
   

  The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "
  
   killer app
  
  " of the business world:
  
   VisiCalc
  
  , a
  
   spreadsheet
  

   program
  
  . VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.
  

    [34]
   

  Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to
  
   Commodore
  
  and
  
   Tandy
  
  .
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   


  By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the
  
   Apple III
  
  in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with
  
   IBM
  
  and
  
   Microsoft
  
  in the business and corporate computing market.
  

    [37]
   

  Jobs and several Apple employees, including
  
   Jef Raskin
  
  , visited
  
   Xerox PARC
  
  in December 1979 to see the
  
   Xerox Alto
  
  .
  
   Xerox
  
  granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.
  

    [38]
   


  Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (
  
   GUI
  
  ), and development of a GUI began for the
  
   Apple Lisa
  
  .
  

    [39]
   

  In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the
  
   Macintosh
  
  . A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.
  

    [40]
   


  On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share,
  

    [41]
   

  generating more capital than any IPO since
  
   Ford Motor Company
  
  in 1956 and instantly creating more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history.
  

    [42]
   


  In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a
  
   programming language
  
  .
  

    [43]
   

  Its debut was signified by
  
   "1984"
  
  , a $1.5
  

  million television commercial directed by
  
   Ridley Scott
  
  that aired during the third quarter of
  
   Super Bowl XVIII
  
  on January 22, 1984.
  

    [44]
   

  The commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success
  

    [45]
   

  and a "masterpiece".
  

    [46]
   



    [47]
   


  The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong
  

    [48]
   

  due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the
  
   LaserWriter
  
  , the first
  
   PostScript
  

   laser printer
  
  to be sold at a reasonable price, and
  
   PageMaker
  
  , an early
  
   desktop publishing
  
  package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.
  

    [49]
   

  The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.
 
  In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO
  
   John Sculley
  
  , who had been hired two years earlier.
  

    [50]
   

  The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a
  
   coup
  
  and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.
  

    [48]
   

  Jobs resigned from Apple and founded
  
   NeXT Inc.
  
  the same year.
  

    [51]
   


  After Jobs' departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher
  
   profit margin
  
  , and appeared to have no effect on total sales as
  
   power users
  
  snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to
  
   Jean-Louis Gassée
  
  's mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55%
  
   profit margins
  
  of the
  
   Macintosh II
  
  .
  

    [52]
   


  This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on
  
   PC clones
  
  that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.
  

    [53]
   

  Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the
  
   Macintosh Classic
  
  ,
  
   Macintosh LC
  
  and
  
   Macintosh IIsi
  
  , all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.
 
  In 1991, Apple introduced the
  
   PowerBook
  
  , replacing the "luggable"
  
   Macintosh Portable
  
  with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced
  
   System 7
  
  , a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the
  
   Classic Mac OS
  
  . The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.
  

    [50]
   

  For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine
  

    MacAddict
   

  named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.
  

    [54]
   


  Apple believed the
  
   Apple II series
  
  was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.
  

    [55]
   

  In 1990, Apple released the
  
   Macintosh LC
  
  , which featured a single
  
   expansion slot
  
  for the
  
   Apple IIe Card
  
  to help migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform;
  

    [55]
   

  the
  
   Apple IIe
  
  was discontinued in 1993.
 
  The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end
  
   Quadra
  
  , the mid-range
  
   Centris
  
  line, and the ill-fated
  
   Performa
  
  series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.
  

    [57]
   


  Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including
  
   digital cameras
  
  ,
  
   portable CD audio players
  
  ,
  
   speakers
  
  ,
  
   video consoles
  
  , the
  
   eWorld
  
  online service, and
  
   TV appliances
  
  . Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued
  
   Newton division
  
  based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.

  Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.

  Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with
  
   Windows
  
  by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.
  

    [58]
   

  Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the
  
   Apple Lisa
  
  in
  

    Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.
   



    [59]
   

  The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. At this time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple's reputation, and Sculley was replaced as CEO by
  
   Michael Spindler
  
  .
  

    [60]
   


  By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as
  
   A/UX
  
  . The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from
  
   OS/2
  
  and
  
   UNIX
  
  vendors such as
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  . The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.
  

    [61]
   


  In 1994, Apple allied with
  
   IBM
  
  and
  
   Motorola
  
  in the
  
   AIM alliance
  
  with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the
  
   PowerPC Reference Platform
  
  ), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the
  
   Power Macintosh
  
  , the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's
  
   PowerPC
  
  processor.
  

    [62]
   


  In 1996, Spindler was replaced by
  
   Gil Amelio
  
  as CEO. Amelio made numerous changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs and cut costs.
  

    [63]
   

  After numerous failed attempts to improve Mac OS, first with the
  
   Taligent
  
  project and later with
  
   Copland
  
  and
  
   Gershwin
  
  , Amelio chose to purchase
  
   NeXT
  
  and its
  
   NeXTSTEP
  
  operating system and bring Steve Jobs back to Apple.
  

    [64]
   


  The NeXT deal was finalized on February 9, 1997,
  

    [65]
   

  bringing Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs acted as the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line; it was during this period that he identified the design talent of
  
   Jonathan Ive
  
  , and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild Apple's status.
  

    [66]
   


  At the 1997
  
   Macworld Expo
  
  , Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft had made a $150
  

  million investment in non-voting Apple stock.
  

    [67]
   

  On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the
  
   Apple Online Store
  
  , which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.
  

    [68]
   



    [69]
   


  On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the
  
   Macintosh 128K
  
  : the
  
   iMac
  
  . The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the
  
   iPod
  
  and the
  
   iPhone
  
  .
  

    [70]
   



    [71]
   

  The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.
  

    [72]
   


  During this period,
  
   [
   


      when?
     


   ]
  
  Apple completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers. In 1998, Apple purchased
  
   Macromedia
  
  's Key Grip software project, signaling an expansion into the
  
   digital video
  
  editing market. The sale was an outcome of Macromedia's decision to solely focus upon web development software. The product, still unfinished at the time of the sale, was renamed "
  
   Final Cut Pro
  
  " when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.
  

    [73]
   



    [74]
   

  The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product
  
   iMovie
  
  in October 1999.
  

    [75]
   

  Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte, which had developed
  
   DVD authoring
  
  technology, as well as Astarte's corresponding products and engineering team in April 2000. Astarte's digital tool DVDirector was subsequently transformed into the professional-oriented
  
   DVD Studio Pro
  
  software product. Apple then employed the same technology to create
  
   iDVD
  
  for the consumer market.
  

    [75]
   

  In 2002, Apple purchased
  
   Nothing Real
  
  for their advanced digital
  
   compositing
  
  application
  
   Shake
  
  ,
  

    [76]
   

  as well as
  
   Emagic
  
  for the music productivity application
  
   Logic
  
  . The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level
  
   GarageBand
  
  application.
  

    [77]
   

  The release of
  
   iPhoto
  
  in the same year completed the
  
   iLife
  
  suite.
  

    [78]
   



   Mac OS X
  
  , based on NeXT's
  
   OPENSTEP
  
  and
  
   BSD Unix
  
  , was released on March 24, 2001, after several years of development. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of
  
   Unix
  
  with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface. To aid users in migrating from
  
   Mac OS 9
  
  , the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the
  
   Classic Environment
  
  .
  

    [79]
   


  On May 19, 2001, Apple opened its first official eponymous
  
   retail stores
  
  in Virginia and California.
  

    [80]
   

  On October 23 of the same year, Apple debuted the
  
   iPod
  
  portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100
  

  million units sold within six years.
  

    [81]
   



    [82]
   

  In 2003, Apple's
  
   iTunes Store
  
  was introduced. The service offered online
  
   music downloads
  
  for $0.99 a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5
  

  billion downloads by June 19, 2008.
  

    [83]
   


  At the
  
   Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would begin producing
  
   Intel
  
  -based Mac computers in 2006.
  

    [84]
   

  On January 10, 2006, the new
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  and
  
   iMac
  
  became the first Apple computers to use Intel's
  
   Core Duo
  
  CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.
  

    [84]
   

  The Power Mac, iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the
  
   Mac Pro
  
  ,
  
   MacBook
  
  , and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.
  

    [85]
   



    [86]
   

  On April 29, 2009,
  

    The Wall Street Journal
   

  reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.
  

    [87]
   

  Apple also introduced
  
   Boot Camp
  
  in 2006 to help users install
  
   Windows XP
  
  or
  
   Windows Vista
  
  on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.

  Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, Apple's
  
   market cap
  
  surpassed that of
  
   Dell
  
  .
  

    [89]
   

  Nine years prior, Dell's CEO
  
   Michael Dell
  
  had said that if he ran Apple he would "shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."
  

    [90]
   

  Although Apple's market share in computers had grown, it remained far behind competitors using Microsoft Windows, accounting for about 8% of desktops and laptops in the US.

  Since 2001, Apple's design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the
  
   iMac G3
  
  . This design change began with the
  
   titanium

   PowerBook

  During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.
  

    [94]
   



    [95]
   

  This event also saw the announcement of the

  The following day, Apple shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point. In May, Apple's share price passed the $100 mark.
  

    [100]
   

  Apple would achieve widespread success with its iPhone,
  
   iPod Touch
  
  and
  
   iPad
  
  products, which introduced innovations in
  
   mobile phones
  
  ,
  
   portable music players
  
  and
  
   personal computers
  
  respectively.
  

    [101]
   

  Furthermore, by early 2007, 800,000 Final Cut Pro users were registered.
  

    [102]
   


  In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without
  
   digital rights management
  
  (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.
  

    [103]
   

  On April 2, 2007, Apple and
  
   EMI
  
  jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.
  

    [104]
   

  Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce the corresponding changes to the iTunes Store.
  

    [105]
   


  In July 2008, Apple launched the
  
   App Store
  
  to sell third-party applications for the
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  .
  

    [106]
   

  Within a month, the store sold 60
  

  million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1
  

  million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.
  

    [107]
   

  By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.
  

    [108]
   


  On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing
  
   Philip Schiller
  
  would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs. The official press release explained that Apple was "scaling back" on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.
  

    [109]
   



    [110]
   


  On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical
  
   leave of absence
  
  from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that "the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well", and explained that the break would allow the company "to focus on delivering extraordinary products".
  

    [111]
   

  Despite Jobs's absence, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the
  
   recession
  
  with revenue of $8.16
  

  billion and profit of $1.21
  

  billion.

  After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the
  
   iPad
  
  on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.
  

    [114]
   

  In May of the same year, Apple's
  
   market cap
  
  exceeded that of competitor
  
   Microsoft
  
  for the first time since 1989.
  

    [115]
   


  In June 2010, Apple released the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  ,
  

    [116]
   

  which introduced
  
   video calling
  
  ,
  
   multitasking
  
  , and a new
  
   uninsulated
  

   stainless steel
  
  design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a
  
   multi-touch
  

   iPod Nano
  
  , an
  
   iPod Touch
  
  with
  
   FaceTime
  
  , and an
  
   iPod Shuffle
  
  that brought back the buttons of earlier generations.
  

    [117]

    [119]
   

  Additionally, on October 20, Apple updated the
  
   MacBook Air
  
  laptop,
  
   iLife
  
  suite of applications, and unveiled
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  , the last version with the name
  

    Mac OS X
   

  .
  

    [120]
   


  In October 2010, Apple shares hit an all-time high, eclipsing $300.
  

    [121]
   


  On January 6, 2011, the company opened its
  
   Mac App Store
  
  , a digital software distribution platform similar to the iOS App Store.
  

    [122]
   


  Alongside peer entities such as Atari and Cisco Systems, Apple was featured in the documentary
  

    Something Ventured
   

  , which premiered in 2011 and explored the three-decade era that led to the establishment and dominance of Silicon Valley.
  

    [123]
   


  On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief Operating Officer
  
   Tim Cook
  
  assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain "involved in major strategic decisions".
  

    [124]
   

  Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.
  

    [125]
   

  In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled
  
   iCloud
  
  , an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.
  

    [126]
   


  This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death. It has been argued that Apple has achieved such efficiency in its supply chain that the company operates as a
  
   monopsony
  
  (one buyer, many sellers) and can dictate terms to its suppliers.
  

    [127]
   



    [128]
   



    [129]
   

  In July 2011, due to the
  
   American debt-ceiling crisis
  
  , Apple's financial reserves were briefly larger than those of the
  
   U.S. Government
  
  .
  

    [130]
   


  On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.
  

    [131]
   

  He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Prior to this, Apple did not have a chairman and instead had two co-lead directors,
  
   Andrea Jung
  
  and
  
   Arthur D. Levinson
  
  , who continued with those titles until Levinson became Chairman of the Board in November.
  

    [132]
   


  On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.
  

    [133]
   



    [134]
   

  The first major product announcement by Apple following Jobs's passing occurred on January 19, 2012, when Apple's
  
   Phil Schiller
  
  introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.
  

    [135]
   

  Jobs had stated in his biography that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.
 
  From 2011 to 2012, Apple released the
  
   iPhone 4S
  


    [136]
   



    [137]
   

  and
  
   iPhone 5
  
  ,
  

    [138]
   



    [139]
   

  which featured improved cameras, an
  
   intelligent software assistant
  
  named
  
   Siri
  
  , and cloud-sourced data with iCloud; the
  
   third
  
  and
  
   fourth
  
  generation iPads, which featured
  
   Retina displays
  
  ;
  

    [140]
   



    [141]
   



    [142]
   

  and the
  
   iPad Mini
  
  , which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.
  

    [143]
   

  These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders
  

    [144]
   

  and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).
  

    [145]
   

  Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  with a Retina display and new
  
   iMac
  
  and
  
   Mac Mini
  
  computers.
  

    [142]
   



    [143]
   



    [146]
   


  On October 29, 2011, Apple purchased C3 Technologies, a mapping company, for $240
  

  million, making it the third mapping company that Apple has purchased.
  

    [147]
   

  On January 10, 2012, Apple paid $500
  

  million to acquire
  
   Anobit
  
  , an Israeli hardware company that developed and supplied a proprietary memory signal processing technology that improved the performance of the flash-memory used in iPhones and iPads.
  

    [148]
   



    [149]
   

  On July 24, 2012, during a conference call with investors, Tim Cook said that he loved
  
   India
  
  , but that Apple was going to expect larger opportunities outside of India. Cook cited the 30% sourcing requirement from India as the reason.

  On August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a world-record $624
  

  billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization set by
  
   Microsoft
  
  in 1999.
  

    [154]
   

  On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05
  

  billion (£665m) in damages in an
  
   intellectual property
  
  lawsuit.
  

    [155]
   

  Samsung appealed the damages award, which the Court reduced by $450
  

  million.
  

    [156]
   

  The Court further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.
  

    [156]
   

  On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that would dismiss all lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.
  

    [157]
   

  It is predicted that Apple will make $280
  

  million a year from this deal with HTC.

  A previously confidential email written by Jobs a year before his death was presented during the proceedings of the
  

    Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.
   

  lawsuits and became publicly available in early April 2014. With a subject line that reads "Top 100 – A," the email was sent only to the company's 100 most senior employees and outlines Jobs's vision of Apple Inc.'s future under 10 subheadings. Notably, Jobs declares a "Holy War with Google" for 2011 and schedules a "new campus" for 2015.

  In March 2013, Apple filed a patent for an augmented reality (AR) system that can identify objects in a live video stream and present information corresponding to these objects through a computer-generated information layer overlaid on top of the real-world image.
  

    [160]
   

  Later in 2013, Apple acquired Embark Inc., a small Silicon Valley-based mapping company that builds free transit apps to help smartphone users navigate public transportation in U.S. cities,
  

    [161]
   

  and
  
   PrimeSense
  
  , an Israeli 3D sensing company based in Tel Aviv.
  

    [162]
   

  In December 2013, Apple Inc. purchased social analytics firm Topsy. Topsy is one of a small number of firms with real-time access to the messages that appear on
  
   Twitter
  
  and can "do real-time analysis of the trends and discussions happening on Twitter".
  

    [163]
   

  The company also made several high-profile hiring decisions in 2013. On July 2, 2013, Apple recruited
  
   Paul Deneve
  
  , Belgian President and CEO of
  
   Yves Saint Laurent
  
  as a vice president reporting directly to Tim Cook.

  A mid-October 2013 announcement revealed that
  
   Burberry
  
  executive
  
   Angela Ahrendts
  
  will commence as a senior vice president at Apple in mid-2014. Ahrendts oversaw Burberry's digital strategy for almost eight years and, during her tenure, sales increased to about US$3.2 billion and shares gained more than threefold.

  On December 6, 2013, Apple Inc. launched
  
   iBeacon
  
  across its 254 U.S. retail stores. Using Bluetooth wireless technology, iBeacon senses the user's exact location within the
  
   Apple store

  Alongside Google vice-president Vint Cerf and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Cook attended a closed-door summit held by President Obama on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the Internet in the wake of the Edward Snowden
  
   NSA incident

   Ankara
  
  to discuss the company's involvement in the
  
   Fatih project

  An anonymous Apple employee revealed to the
  
   Bloomberg
  
  media publication that the opening of a
  
   Tokyo
  
  , Japan, store was planned for 2014. A Japanese analyst has stated, "For Apple, the Japanese market is appealing in terms of quantity and price. There is room to expand tablet sales and a possibility the Japanese market expands if Apple's mobile carrier partners increase."

  . The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display,
  
   Bluetooth
  
  , and
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  (both "b" and "g").
  

    [197]
   


  A second version, the
  
   iPhone 3G
  
  , was released on July 11, 2008, with a reduced price of $199 for the 8 GB version and $299 for the 16 GB version.
  

    [200]
   

  This version added support for
  
   3G
  
  networking and
  
   assisted-GPS
  
  navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the original model were eliminated in favor of a glossy, curved black or white back. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the
  
   App Store
  
  , which provided iPhone-compatible applications to download. On April 24, 2009, the App Store
  

    [201]
   

  surpassed one billion downloads.
  

    [202]
   

  On June 8, 2009, Apple announced the
  
   iPhone 3GS
  
  . It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.
 
  At the
  
   Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  (WWDC) on June 7, 2010, Apple announced the redesigned
  
   iPhone 4
  
  .
  

    [203]
   

  It featured a 960x640 display, the
  
   Apple A4
  
  processor, a
  
   gyroscope
  
  for enhanced gaming, a 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing
  
   VGA
  
  camera and
  
   FaceTime
  
  video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a "Bumper Case" distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook
  
   Nokia
  
  to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.
  

    [204]
   

  On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  , which was first released on October 14, 2011.
  

    [205]
   

  It features the
  
   Apple A5
  
  processor and
  
   Siri
  
  voice assistant technology, the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010.
  

    [206]
   

  It also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple began a new
  
   accessibility
  
  feature, Made for iPhone
  
   Hearing Aids
  
  with the iPhone 4S.
  

    [207]
   

  Made for iPhone Hearing Aids feature Live Listen, it can help you hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.
  

    [208]
   

  Apple sold 4
  

  million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days of availability.
  

    [209]
   


  On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  .
  

    [210]
   

  It has a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded
  
   Apple A6
  
  chip, among several other improvements.
  

    [211]
   

  Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering
  

    [212]
   

  and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch.
  

    [213]
   

  Upon the launch of the
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  and
  
   iPhone 5C
  
  , Apple set a new record for first-weekend smartphone sales by selling over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch.
  

    [214]
   

  The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time that Apple simultaneously launched two models.
  

    [215]
   


  A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.
  

    [216]
   


  In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer
  
   Jonathan Ive
  
  used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:
 
   We don't take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don't usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot. It's extraordinary!
   

     [66]
    


  On September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the
  
   iPhone 6
  
  , alongside the
  
   iPhone 6 Plus
  
  that both have screen sizes over 4-inches.
  

    [217]
   

  One year later, Apple introduced the
  
   iPhone 6S
  
  , and
  
   iPhone 6S Plus
  
  , which introduced a new technology called 3D Touch, including an increase of the rear camera to 12 MP, and the FaceTime camera to 5 MP.
  

    [218]
   

  On March 21, 2016, Apple introduced the
  
   iPhone SE
  
  that has a 4-inch size last used with the 5S and has the same internal hardware as the 6S.
  

    [219]
   


  On September 7, 2016, Apple introduced the
  
   iPhone 7
  
  and the
  
   iPhone 7 Plus
  
  , which feature improved system and graphics performance, add water resistance, a new rear dual-camera system on the 7 Plus model, and, controversially, remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack.
  

    [220]
   



    [221]
   


  On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media
  
   tablet
  
  , the
  
   iPad
  
  , which runs a modified version of iOS. It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen.
  

    [222]
   

  It also includes a mobile version of
  
   Safari
  
  for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store,
  
   iTunes
  
  Library,
  
   iBookstore
  
  , Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  and optional
  
   3G
  
  service or synced through the user's computer.
  

    [223]
   


   AT&T
  
  was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.
  

    [224]
   


  On March 2, 2011, Apple introduced the
  
   iPad 2
  
  , which had a faster processor and a camera on the front and back. It also added support for optional 3G service provided by
  
   Verizon
  
  in addition to
  
   AT&T
  
  .
  

    [225]
   

  The availability of the iPad 2 was initially limited as a result of a devastating
  
   earthquake and tsunami
  
  in Japan in March 2011.
  

    [226]
   


  The third-generation iPad was released on March 7, 2012, and marketed as "
  
   the new iPad
  
  ". It added
  
   LTE
  
  service from AT&T or Verizon, an upgraded
  
   A5X
  
  processor, and Retina display. The dimensions and form factor remained relatively unchanged, with the new iPad being a fraction thicker and heavier than the previous version and featuring minor positioning changes.
  

    [227]
   


  On October 23, 2012, Apple's fourth-generation iPad came out, marketed as the "
  
   iPad with Retina display
  
  ". It added the upgraded
  
   A6X
  
  processor and replaced the traditional 30-pin dock connector with the all-digital
  
   Lightning connector
  
  .
  

    [228]
   

  The
  
   iPad Mini
  
  was also introduced. It featured a reduced 7.9-inch display and much of the same internal specifications as the iPad 2.
  

    [229]
   


  On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the
  
   iPad Air
  
  and the iPad Mini with Retina Display, both featuring a new 64-bit Apple A7 processor.
  

    [230]
   


  The
  
   iPad Air 2
  
  was unveiled on October 16, 2014. It added better graphics and central processing and a camera burst mode as well as minor updates. The
  
   iPad Mini 3
  
  was unveiled at the same time.
  

    [230]
   


  Since its launch, iPad users have downloaded over three billion apps. The total number of App Store downloads, as of June 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , is over 100
  

  billion.
  

    [231]
   


  On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the
  
   iPad Pro
  
  , an iPad with a 12.9-inch display that supports two new accessories, the
  
   Smart Keyboard
  
  and
  
   Apple Pencil
  
  .
  

    [232]
   

  A 9.7-inch iPad Pro was announced on March 21, 2016.
  

    [233]
   


  The Apple Watch
  
   smartwatch
  
  was announced by Cook on September 9, 2014,
  

    [235]
   



    [236]
   

  and released on April 24, 2015.
  

    [237]
   



    [238]
   



    [239]
   

  The wearable device consists of fitness-tracking capabilities that are similar to
  
   Fitbit
  
  , and must be used in combination with an iPhone to work (only the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  , or later models, are compatible with the Apple Watch).
  

    [240]
   



    [241]
   


  The second generation of Apple Watch,
  
   Apple Watch Series 2
  
  and Apple Watch Series 1 were released in September 2016.
  

    [242]
   


  At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the
  
   Apple TV
  
  (previously known as the iTV),
  

    [243]
   

  a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for
  
   HDMI
  
  and
  
   component video
  
  , and played video at a maximum resolution of
  
   720p
  
  .
  

    [244]
   

  On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model.
  

    [245]
   

  A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.
  

    [246]
   


  In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of
  
   flash memory
  
  to
  
   cache
  
  media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation
  
   iPod Touch
  
  .
  

    [247]
   


  It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including
  
   YouTube
  
  and
  
   Netflix
  
  , and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.
 
  At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of OS X,
  
   tvOS
  
  , and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new
  
   Siri Remote
  
  with a glass
  
   touchpad
  
  ,
  
   gyroscope
  
  , and
  
   microphone
  
  .
 
  Apple develops its own
  
   operating system
  
  to run on Macs,
  
   macOS
  
  , the latest version being
  
   macOS Sierra
  
  (version 10.12). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its macOS operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles
  
   iMovie
  
  ,
  
   iPhoto
  
  and
  
   GarageBand
  
  . For presentation, page layout and word processing,
  
   iWork
  
  is available, which includes
  
   Keynote
  
  ,
  
   Pages
  
  , and
  
   Numbers
  
  . iTunes,
  
   QuickTime
  
  media player, and
  
   Software Update
  
  are available as free downloads for both macOS and
  
   Windows
  
  .
 
  Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system
  
   macOS Server
  
  ;
  
   Apple Remote Desktop
  
  , a remote systems management application; and
  
   Xsan
  
  , a
  
   Storage Area Network
  
  file system. For the professional creative market, there is
  
   Final Cut Pro
  
  , a video production suite;
  
   Logic Pro
  
  , a comprehensive music toolkit; and
  
   Motion
  
  , an advanced effects composition program.
 
  Apple also offers online services with
  
   iCloud
  
  , which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos, and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by
  
   MobileMe
  
  , .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.
 
  According to the
  

    Sydney Morning Herald
   

  , Apple wants to start producing an
  
   electric car
  
  with
  
   autonomous driving
  
  as soon as 2020. Apple has made efforts to recruit battery development engineers and other electric automobile engineers from
  
   A123 Systems
  
  ,
  
   LG Chem
  
  ,
  
   Samsung Electronics
  
  ,
  
   Panasonic
  
  ,
  
   Toshiba
  
  ,
  
   Johnson Controls
  
  and
  
   Tesla Motors
  
  .
  

    [248]
   


  Apple Energy, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells
  
   solar energy
  
  . As of June 6, 2016, Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.
  

    [249]
   



    [250]
   

  In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a
  
   landfill gas energy plant
  
  in
  
   North Carolina
  
  . Apple will use the
  
   methane
  
  emissions to generate electricity.
  

    [251]
   

  Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.
  

    [252]
   


  According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a
  
   fruitarian
  
  diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".
  

    [254]
   


  Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts
  
   Sir Isaac Newton
  
  sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by
  
   Rob Janoff
  
  's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.
  

    [255]
   



    [256]
   

  The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.
  

    [257]
   

  The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.
  

    [257]
   

  This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to
  
   Alan Turing
  
  , with the bite mark a reference to
  
   his method of suicide
  
  .
  

    [258]
   



    [259]
   

  Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.
  

    [257]
   



    [260]
   


  On August 27, 1999
  

    [261]
   

  (the year following the introduction of the
  
   iMac G3
  
  ), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation. An
  
   Aqua
  
  -themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1998 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.
  

    [262]
   


  Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were
  
   Beatles
  
  fans,
  

    [263]
   



    [264]
   

  but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with
  
   Apple Corps Ltd.
  
  , a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967. This resulted in a
  
   series of lawsuits
  
  and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.
  

    [265]
   


  Apple's first slogan, "
  
   Byte
  
  into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s.
  

    [266]
   

  From 1997 to 2002, the slogan "
  
   Think Different
  
  " was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.
  

    [267]
   

  Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,
  

    [268]
   

  and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements.
  

    [269]
   

  "Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh,
  
   Newton
  
  , iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.
  

    [270]
   


  From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the
  
   1984 Super Bowl commercial
  
  to the more modern '
  
   Get a Mac
  
  ' adverts, Apple has been recognized in for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns
  
   were criticized
  
  , particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.
  

    [271]
   



    [272]
   



    [273]
   

  Apple's product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.
  

    [274]
   

  Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple commercials include Canadian singer
  
   Feist
  
  with the song "
  
   1234
  
  " and
  
   Yael Naïm
  
  with the song "
  
   New Soul
  
  ".
  

    [274]
   


     "The scenes I witnessed at the opening of the new Apple store in London's
     
      Covent Garden
     
     were more like an evangelical prayer meeting than a chance to buy a phone or a laptop."
    
  Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history.
  

    BYTE
   

  in 1984 stated that
  

    [276]
   


   There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.
  
   Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the
   
    American Dream
   
   . Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.
  

   Apple evangelists
  
  were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple
  
   evangelist
  

   Guy Kawasaki
  
  has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon,"
  

    [277]
   

  while Ive explained in 2014 that "People have an incredibly personal relationship" with Apple's products.
  

    [66]
   


   Apple Store
  
  openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.
  

    [278]
   

  The opening of
  
   New York City
  
  's
  
   Fifth Avenue
  
  "Cube" store had a line half a mile long; a few Mac fans used the setting to propose marriage.
  

    [279]
   

  The line for the
  
   Ginza
  
  opening in Tokyo was estimated to include thousands of people and exceeded eight city blocks.
  

    [280]
   

  The high level of brand loyalty has been criticized and ridiculed, applying the epithet "
  
   Apple fanboy
  
  " and mocking the lengthy lines before a product launch.
  

    [281]
   

  An internal memo leaked in 2015 suggested the company planned to discourage long lines and direct customers to purchase its products on its website.
  

    [282]
   




    Fortune
   

  magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.
  

    [283]
   



    [284]
   



    [285]
   



    [286]
   



    [287]
   

  On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed
  
   Coca-Cola
  
  to become the world's most valuable brand in the
  
   Omnicom Group
  
  's "Best Global Brands" report.
  

    [288]
   


   Boston Consulting Group
  
  has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year since 2005.
  

    [289]
   


  John Sculley told
  

    The Guardian
   

  newspaper in 1997: "People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade."
  

    [290]
   

  Research in 2002 by
  
   NetRatings
  
  indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products were more expensive than other PC products.
  

    [291]
   



    [292]
   


  In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathan Ive responded:
 
   What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It's a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.
   

     [66]
    


  The Apple website
  
   home page
  
  has been used to commemorate, or pay tribute to, milestones and events outside of Apple's product offerings:

  In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus in Cupertino about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus and next to Interstate 280.
  

    [308]
   

  The new campus building will be designed by
  
   Norman Foster
  
  .
  

    [309]
   

  The Cupertino City Council approved the proposed "spaceship" design campus on October 15, 2013, after a 2011 presentation by Jobs detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central, four-storied, circular building surrounded by extensive landscape. It will feature a café with room for 3,000 sitting people and parking underground as well as in a parking structure. The 2.8
  

  million square foot facility will also include Jobs's original designs for a fitness center and a corporate auditorium.

  Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of
  
   corporate culture
  
  . Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a
  
   Fortune 500
  
  company. By the time of the "1984" television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.
  

    [332]
   

  According to a 2011 report in
  

    Fortune
   
   ,
  
  this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.
  

    [333]
   


  As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often take longer than projects with it.
  

    [334]
   

  To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to
  
   personal computing
  
  while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including
  
   Bill Atkinson
  
  ,

  At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance,
  
   Ron Johnson
  
  —Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).
  

    [341]
   

  Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual," or "DRI" in Apple jargon.
  

    [333]
   

  As an example, when iOS senior vice president
  
   Scott Forstall
  
  refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned
  
   Maps app
  
  , he was forced to resign.
  

    [342]
   

  Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.
  

    [343]
   


  An editorial article in
  

    The Verge
   

  in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that "a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that
  
   Walkman
  
  didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the
  
   iCloud
  
  cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an
  
   Apple Watch
  
  can unlock a
  
   Mac
  
  in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.

  In 1999 Apple retained Eight Inc. as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the Apple retail stores. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc. prepared an "Apple Retail" white paper for Jobs, outlining the ability of separate Apple retail stores to directly drive the Apple brand experience—Kobe used their recently completed work with The North Face and Nike as a basis for the white paper.

  A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple's "At-Home Apple Advisors" customer support program that serves as the corporation's call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program and testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.

  The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: "Nobody wants to buy sour milk".

  During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.
  

    [351]
   

  This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the
  
   PCI
  
  bus in the
  
   7500
  
  /
  
   8500
  
  /
  
   9500
  

   Power Macs
  
  . Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as
  
   USB
  
  ,
  
   AGP
  
  ,
  
   HyperTransport
  
  ,
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  ,
  
   NVMe
  
  ,
  
   PCIe
  
  and others in its products.
  
   FireWire
  
  is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as
  
   IEEE 1394
  
  and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.
  

    [352]
   


  The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of
  
   outsourcing
  
  initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by
  

    The New York Times
   

  , Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".
  

    [353]
   


  In 2006, the
  

    Mail on Sunday
   

  reported on the working conditions of the Chinese factories where contract manufacturers
  
   Foxconn
  
  and
  
   Inventec
  
  produced the iPod.
  

    [354]
   

  The article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.
  

    [355]
   



    [356]
   



    [357]
   


  Apple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.
  

    [358]
   

  In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding
  
   worker's rights
  
  , slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.
  

    [359]
   

  In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.
  

    [360]
   


  The
  
   Foxconn suicides
  
  occurred between January and November 2010, when 18
  

    [361]
   


   Foxconn
  
  (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted
  
   suicide
  
  , resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.
  

    [361]
   



    [362]
   



    [363]
   

  The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.
  

    [364]
   

  Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:
 
   [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.
   

     [365]
    


  The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.
  

    [365]
   

  Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.
  

    [366]
   


  Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.
  

    [367]
   

  After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,
  

    [368]
   

  workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.
  

    [369]
   

  Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-
  
   hexane
  
  , a
  
   neurotoxin
  
  that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.
  

    [370]
   



    [371]
   



    [372]
   


  A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: "We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".
  

    [366]
   


  In December 2014, the
  
   Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights
  
  published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room." Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.
  

    [373]
   



    [374]
   


  Following a
  
   Greenpeace
  
  protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.
  

    [375]
   



    [376]
   

  By 2013 Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.
  

    [377]
   


  In 2010,
  
   Climate Counts
  
  , a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding".
  

    [378]
   

  This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".
  

    [379]
   


  As of 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on
  
   renewable energy
  
  , 100% of Apple's
  
   data centers
  
  run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.
  

    [380]
   

  However, the facilities are connected to the local
  
   grid
  
  which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple
  
   carbon offsets
  
  its electricity use.
  

    [381]

  The
  
   Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool
  
  (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple
  
   tablet
  
  ,
  
   notebook
  
  ,
  
   desktop computer
  
  , and
  
   display
  
  that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,
  

    [383]
   

  the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573
  

  million gallons in 2015.
  

    [384]
   


  In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, "Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet."
  

    [385]
   


  During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations.
  
   Lisa P. Jackson
  
  , Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from
  
   post-consumer recycled
  
  paper or sustainably-managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.
  

    [386]
   



    [387]
   

  Apple working in partnership with
  
   Conservation Fund
  
  , have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in
  
   Maine
  
  and
  
   North Carolina
  
  . Another partnership announced is with the
  
   World Wildlife Fund
  
  to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40
  
   MW
  

   solar power plant
  
  in the
  
   Sichuan
  
  province of
  
   China
  
  that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In
  
   Singapore
  
  , Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.
  

    [388]
   


  Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its
  
   glass production
  
  for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.
  

    [389]
   

  Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with
  
   UL's
  
  Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is
  
   reused
  
  ,
  
   recycled
  
  ,
  
   composted
  
  , or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly, 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from
  
   landfills
  
  .
  

    [390]
   


  Following further campaigns by Greenpeace,
  

    [391]
   

  in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to fully eliminate all
  
   polyvinyl chloride
  
  (PVC) and
  
   brominated flame retardants
  
  (BFRs) in its complete product line.
  

    [392]
   



    [393]
   

  In June 2007, Apple began replacing the
  
   cold cathode
  
  fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit
  
   LCD
  
  displays in its computers with
  
   mercury
  
  -free
  
   LED-backlit LCD displays

  In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how "green" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.

  Greenpeace praises Apple's
  
   sustainability
  
  , noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.

  In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing

  In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108
  

  billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65
  

  billion—and nearly $82
  

  billion in
  
   cash reserves

  On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share
  
   dividend
  
  beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.

  On September 2012, Apple reached a record share price of more than $705 and closed at above 700.

  With 936,596,000 outstanding shares (as of June 30, 2012
  

    [update]
   

  ),
  

    [410]
   


  The company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170
  

  billion.

  In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the
  
   Fortune 500
  
  list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.
  

    [412]
   

  As of 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , Apple has around US$234
  

  billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.

  Apple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by
  
   Canaccord Genuity
  
  . In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.

  Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as
  
   Ireland
  
  , the
  
   Netherlands
  
  ,
  
   Luxembourg
  
  and the
  
   British Virgin Islands
  
  to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to
  
   The New York Times,
  
  in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "
  
   Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich
  
  ," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.

   British Conservative Party
  
  Member of Parliament
  
   Charlie Elphicke
  
  published research on October 30, 2012,
  

    [416]
   

  which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard
  
   corporation tax
  
  . He followed this research by calling on the
  
   Chancellor of the Exchequer
  

   George Osborne
  
  to force these multinationals, which also included
  
   Google
  
  and
  
   The Coca-Cola Company
  
  , to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.
  

    [417]
   


  It is a matter of
  
   public record
  
  that Apple Inc. is the single largest taxpayer to the
  
   Department of the Treasury
  
  of the
  
   United States of America
  
  with an
  
   effective tax rate
  
  of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple
  
   Fiscal Year
  
  2016.
  

    [418]
   


  In 2015,
  
   Reuters
  
  reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4
  

  billion which were untaxed by the
  
   IRS
  
  of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the
  
   IRC
  
  , corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its
  
   shareholders
  
  it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.
  

    [419]
   



    [420]
   


  On August 30, 2016, after
  
   a three-year investigation
  
  by the EU's competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received "illegal state aid" from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13
  

  billion euros ($14.5
  

  billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes.
  

    [421]
   

  Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless "head office" entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013).
  

    [422]
   

  The Chancellor of
  
   Austria
  
  ,
  
   Christian Kern
  
  , put this decision into perspective by stating that "every
  
   Viennese
  
  cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation".

  Apple Inc. is a

  Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.
  

    [426]
   

  In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include
  

    Apple v. Samsung
   

  ,
  

    Apple v. Microsoft
   

  ,
  

    Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.
   

  , and
  

    Apple Corps v. Apple Computer
   

  . Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as
  
   shell companies
  
  known as
  
   patent trolls
  
  , with no evidence of actual use of
  
   patents
  
  in question.
  

    [427]
   

  Most recently, on December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.

  Apple has made clear its stance on privacy and as such has made available Transparency Reports on the Governmental Requests it receives. Apple states plainly, "On devices running
  
   iOS 8
  
  and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of your passcode.
  

    [305]
   

  For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an
  
   encryption key
  
  that is tied to the user's passcode, which Apple does not possess."
  

    [430]
   


  In its latest "Who Has Your Back?" report, once again the
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  (EFF) awarded Apple 5 out of 5 stars "commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy."

  Following media reports about
  
   PRISM
  
  , NSA's massive electronic
  
   surveillance program
  
  , in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Apple. According to leaks of said program, Apple joined the PRISM program in 2012.

  On April 14, 2016, Apple and the
  
   World Wide Fund for Nature
  
  (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, "help protect life on our planet." Apple released a special page in the
  
   iTunes App Store
  
  , Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8
  

  million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.
