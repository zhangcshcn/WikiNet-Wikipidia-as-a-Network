   NeXTstation
  
  is a high-end
  
   workstation computer
  
  developed, manufactured and sold by
  
   NeXT
  
  from 1990 until 1993. It runs the
  
   NeXTSTEP
  

   operating system
  
  . The NeXTstation was released as a more affordable alternative to the
  
   NeXTcube
  
  at about
  
   US$4,995
  
  or about half the price. Several models were produced, including the NeXTstation (25 MHz), NeXTstation Turbo (33 MHz), NeXTstation Color (25 MHz) and NeXTstation Turbo Color (33 MHz). In total, NeXT sold about 50,000 computers (not including sales to government organizations), making the NeXTstation a rarity today.

  The NeXTstation originally shipped with a NeXT
  
   MegaPixel
  
  17"
  
   monitor
  
  (with built-in
  
   speakers
  
  ), keyboard, and mouse. It is nicknamed "the slab", since the flat shape contrasts quite sharply with the original
  
   NeXT Computer
  
  's basic shape (otherwise known as "the cube").
