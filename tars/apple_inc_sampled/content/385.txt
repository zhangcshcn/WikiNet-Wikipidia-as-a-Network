   Bing
  
  is a
  
   web search engine
  
  owned and operated by
  
   Microsoft
  
  . The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines:
  
   MSN Search
  
  ,
  
   Windows Live Search
  
  and later
  
   Live Search
  
  . Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using
  
   ASP.NET
  
  .
 
  Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO
  
   Steve Ballmer
  
  on May 28, 2009, at the
  

    All Things Digital
   

  conference in
  
   San Diego
  
  , California, for release on June 1, 2009.
  

    [3]
   

  Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called "Explore pane") based on
  
   semantic technology
  
  from
  
   Powerset
  
  ,
  

    [4]
   

  which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.
  

    [5]
   


  In July 2009, Microsoft and
  
   Yahoo!
  
  announced a deal in which Bing would power
  
   Yahoo! Search
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners made the transition by early 2012.
  

    [7]
   

  The deal was altered in 2015, meaning Yahoo! was only required to use Bing for a "majority" of searches.
  

    [8]
   


  In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as "Tiger", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.
  

    [9]
   

  In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes "Sidebar", a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search query.
  

    [10]
   


  As of November 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , Bing is the second largest search engine in the US with a query volume of 20.9%, behind
  
   Google
  
  on 63.9%.
  
   Yahoo! Search
  
  , which Bing largely powers, has 12.5%.
  

    [11]
   




  Microsoft originally launched
  
   MSN
  
  Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from
  
   Inktomi
  
  . It consisted of a search engine, index, and
  
   web crawler
  
  . In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from
  
   Looksmart
  
  blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from
  
   AltaVista
  
  were used instead. Since then Microsoft upgraded MSN Search to provide its own self-built search engine results, the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily. The upgrade started as a
  
   beta
  
  program in November 2004, and came out of beta in February 2005. Image search was powered by a third party,
  
   Picsearch
  
  . The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market.
 
  The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search. The new search engine used search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and
  
   Microsoft Encarta
  
  .
 
  In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.
  

    [12]
   


  On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the
  
   Windows Live
  
  services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the
  
   Live Search and Ad Platform
  
  headed by
  
   Satya Nadella
  
  , part of Microsoft's Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with
  
   Microsoft adCenter
  
  .
  

    [13]
   


  A series of reorganisations and consolidations of Microsoft's search offerings were made under the Live Search branding. On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of
  
   Live Search Books
  
  and
  
   Live Search Academic
  
  and integrated all academic and book search results into regular search, and as a result this also included the closure of
  
   Live Search Books Publisher Program
  
  . Soon after,
  
   Windows Live Expo
  
  was discontinued on July 31, 2008. Live Search Macros, a service for users to create their own custom search engines or use macros created by other users, was also discontinued shortly after. On May 15, 2009,
  
   Live Product Upload
  
  , a service which allowed merchants to upload products information onto
  
   Live Search Products
  
  , was discontinued. The final reorganisation came as
  
   Live Search QnA
  
  was rebranded as
  
   MSN QnA
  
  on February 18, 2009, however, it was subsequently discontinued on May 21, 2009.
  

    [14]
   


  Microsoft recognised that there would be a problem with branding as long as the word "Live" remained in the name.
  

    [15]
   

  As an effort to create a new identity for Microsoft's search services, Live Search was officially replaced by Bing on June 3, 2009.
  

    [16]
   


  The Bing name was chosen through focus groups, and Microsoft decided that the name was memorable, short, easy to spell, and that it would function well as a URL around the world. The word would remind people of the sound made during "the moment of discovery and decision making."
  

    [17]
   

  Microsoft was assisted by branding consultancy
  
   Interbrand
  
  in their search for the best name for the new search engine.
  

    [18]
   

  The name also has strong similarity to the word '
  
   bingo
  
  ', which is used to mean that something sought has been found or realized, as is interjected when winning the game
  
   Bingo
  
  . Microsoft advertising strategist David Webster originally proposed the name "Bang" for the same reasons the name Bing was ultimately chosen (easy to spell, one syllable, and easy to remember). He noted, "It's there, it's an exclamation point [...] It's the opposite of a question mark." This name was ultimately not chosen because it could not be properly used as a verb in the context of an internet search; Webster commented "Oh, 'I banged it' is very different than 'I binged it'".
  

    [19]
   


  According to the
  
   Guardian
  
  "[Microsoft] hasn't confirmed that it stands recursively for Bing Is Not Google, but that's the sort of joke software engineers enjoy."
  

    [20]
   

  Qi Lu, president of Microsoft Online Services, also announced that Bing's official Chinese name is
  
   bì yìng
  
  (
  
   simplified Chinese
  
  :
  
   必应
  
  ;
  
   traditional Chinese
  
  :
  
   必應
  
  ), which literally means "very certain to respond" or "very certain to answer" in Chinese.
  

    [21]
   


  While being tested internally by Microsoft employees, Bing's codename was
  

    Kumo
   

  (
  
   くも
  
  ),
  

    [22]
   

  which came from the
  
   Japanese
  
  word for
  

    spider
   

  (
  
   蜘蛛
  
  ;
  
   くも
  
  ,
  

    kumo
   

  ) as well as
  

    cloud
   

  (
  
   雲
  
  ;
  
   くも
  
  ,
  

    kumo
   

  ), referring to the manner in which search engines "
  
   spider
  
  " Internet resources to add them to their database, as well as
  
   cloud computing
  
  .
 
  On July 31, 2009, The Laptop Company, Inc. stated in a press release that it would challenge Bing's trademark application, alleging that Bing may cause confusion in the marketplace as Bing and their product BongoBing both do online product search.
  

    [23]
   

  Software company TeraByte Unlimited, which has a product called BootIt Next Generation (abbreviated to BING), also contended the trademark application on similar grounds, as did a Missouri-based design company called Bing! Information Design.
  

    [24]
   


  Microsoft contended that claims challenging its trademark were without merit because these companies filed for U.S. federal trademark applications only after Microsoft filed for the Bing trademark in March 2009.
  

    [25]
   


  On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that they had made a ten-year deal in which the Yahoo! search engine would be replaced by Bing, retaining the Yahoo!
  
   user interface
  
  . Yahoo! will get to keep 88% of the revenue from all search ad sales on its site for the first five years of the deal, and have the right to sell advertising on some Microsoft sites.
  

    [26]
   



    [27]
   

  All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners made the transition by early 2012.
  

    [7]
   



   Facebook
  
  users have the option to share their searches with their Facebook friends using
  
   Facebook Connect
  
  .
  

    [32]
   


  On June 10, 2013,
  
   Apple
  
  announced that it would be dropping Google as its web search engine in favour of Bing.
  

    [33]
   

  This feature is only integrated with iOS 7 and higher and for users with an iPhone 4S or higher as the feature is only integrated with Siri, Apple's personal assistant.
 

   Windows 8.1
  
  includes Bing "Smart Search" integration, which processes all queries submitted through the Windows Start Screen.
  

    [34]
   

  The Bing integration captures a variety of features, one of the most prominent and advertised: Hero Search. This feature allows users to browse for popular and well-known places, objects or people. Searching France, for example, will show popular search items, such as population, calling code and date founded. The current weather and location are also directly accessible using Bing Weather and Bing maps. The "Hero" result will go further to provide attractions using Bing Images and popular websites relating to France, such as France Wikipedia and France's official website. Searching an artist will display similar results with the option to play music using the Windows 8-integrated
  
   Groove Music
  
  application.
 
  Bing Translator is a user facing translation portal provided by Microsoft to translate texts or entire web pages into different languages. All translation pairs are powered by the
  
   Microsoft Translator
  
  , a
  
   statistical machine translation
  
  platform and web service, developed by
  
   Microsoft Research
  
  , as its backend translation software. Two transliteration pairs (between
  
   Chinese (Simplified)
  
  and
  
   Chinese (Traditional)
  
  ) are provided by Microsoft's Windows International team.
  

    [35]
   

  As of April 2017, Bing Translator offers translations in 60 different language systems.
  

    [36]
   


  Bing Translator can translate phrases entered by the user or acquire a link to a web page and translate its entirely. When translating an entire web page, or when the user selects "Translate this page" in Bing search results, the Bilingual Viewer is shown, which allows users to browse the original web page text and translation in parallel, supported by synchronized highlights, scrolling, and navigation.
  

    [37]
   

  Four Bilingual Viewer layouts are available: side by side, top and bottom, original with hover translation and translation with hover original.
 
  Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.
  

    [38]
   

  Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.
  

    [39]
   


  In addition to its tool for searching
  
   web pages
  
  , Bing also provides the following search offerings:
  

    [40]
   


  Bing allows webmasters to manage the
  
   web crawling
  
  status of their own websites through
  
   Bing Webmaster Center
  
  . Additionally, users may also submit contents to Bing via the
  
   Bing Local Listing Center
  
  , which allows businesses to add business listings onto
  
   Bing Maps
  
  and Bing Local.
 

   Bing Mobile
  
  allow users to conduct search queries on their mobile devices, either via the mobile browser or a downloadable mobile application.
 
  Bing Application Programming Interface enables developers to programmatically submit queries and retrieve results from the Bing Engine.
  
   http://www.bing.com/developers
  

  To use the Bing API developers have to obtain an Application ID,
  
   http://www.bing.com/developers/createapp.aspx
  

  Bing API can be used with following protocols:
 
  Query examples:
 
  The Bing Bar, a
  
   browser extension
  

   toolbar
  
  that replaced the MSN Toolbar, provides users with links to Bing and MSN content from within their web browser without needing to navigate away from a web page they are already on. The user can customize the theme and color scheme of the Bing Bar as well as choose which MSN content buttons to present within the user interface. Bing Bar also displays the current local weather forecast and stock market positions.
  

    [44]
   


  The Bing Bar features integration with Microsoft Bing search engine. In addition to the traditional web search functions, Bing Bar also allows search on other Bing services such as Images, Video, News and Maps. When users perform a search on another search engine, the Bing Bar's search box will automatically populate itself, allowing the user to view the results from Bing, should it be desired.
 
  Bing Bar also links to
  
   Outlook.com
  
  ,
  
   Skype
  
  and
  
   Facebook
  
  .
  

    [45]
   


  Microsoft released a beta version of Bing Desktop, a program developed to allow users to search Bing from the desktop, on April 4, 2012.
  

    [46]
   

  The initial release followed shortly on April 24, 2012, supporting
  
   Windows 7
  
  only.
  

    [47]
   

  With the release of version 1.1 in December 2012 it supported Windows XP and higher.
  

    [48]
   


  Bing Desktop allows users to initiate a web search from the desktop, view news headlines, automatically set their background to the Bing homepage image, or choose a background from the previous nine background images.
  

    [49]
   


  A similar program, the Bing Search gadget, was a
  
   Windows Sidebar
  

   Gadget
  
  that used Bing to fetch the user's search results and render them directly in the gadget. Another gadget, the Bing Maps gadget, displayed real-time traffic conditions using Bing Maps.
  

    [50]
   

  The gadget provided shortcuts to driving directions, local search and full-screen traffic view of major US and Canadian cities, including
  
   Atlanta
  
  ,
  
   Boston
  
  ,
  
   Chicago
  
  ,
  
   Denver
  
  ,

   Tampa
  
  ,
  
   Toronto
  
  ,
  
   Vancouver
  
  , and
  
   Washington, D.C.
  

  Prior to October 30, 2007, the gadgets were known as
  
   Live Search gadget
  
  and
  
   Live Search Maps gadget
  
  ; both gadgets were removed from
  
   Windows Live Gallery
  
  due to possible security concerns.
  

    [51]
   

  The Live Search Maps gadget was made available for download again on January 24, 2008 with the security concern addressed.
  

    [52]
   

  However around the introduction of Bing in June 2009 both gadgets have been removed again for download from
  
   Windows Live Gallery
  
  .
 
  Before the launch of Bing, the marketshare of Microsoft web search pages (MSN and Live search) had been small. By January 2011, Experian Hitwise show that Bing's market share had increased to 12.8% at the expense of Yahoo! and
  
   Google
  
  . Bing powered searches also continued to have a higher "success rate" compared to Google, with more users clicking on the resulting links.

  In the same period, comScore’s "2010 U.S. Digital Year in Review" report showed that "Bing was the big gainer in year-over-year search activity, picking up 29% more searches in 2010 than it did in 2009".
  

    [53]
   

  The
  

    Wall Street Journal
   

  notes the 1% jump in share "appeared to come at the expense of rival Google Inc".
  

    [54]
   

  In February 2011, Bing beat Yahoo! for the first time with 4.37% search share while Yahoo! received 3.93%.
  

    [55]
   


  Counting core searches only, i.e., those where the user has an intent to interact with the search result, Bing had a market share of 14.54% in the second quarter of 2011 in the United States.
  

    [32]
   



    [56]
   



    [57]
   



    [58]
   


  The combined "Bing Powered" U.S. searches have declined from 26.5% in 2011 to 25.9% in April 2012.
  

    [59]
   

  By November 2015, its market share had declined further to 20.9%.
  

    [60]
   


  Since 2006, Microsoft had conducted a number of tie-ins and promotions for promoting Microsoft's search offerings. These include:
 
  Bing's debut featured an $80 to $100 million online, TV, print, and radio advertising campaign in the US. The advertisements do not mention other search engine competitors, such as Google and Yahoo!, directly by name; rather, they attempt to convince users to switch to Bing by focusing on Bing's search features and functionality.
  

    [64]
   

  The ads claim that Bing does a better job countering "search overload".
  

    [65]
   


  Bing has been heavily advertised as a "decision engine",
  

    [66]
   

  though thought by columnist David Berkowitz to be more closely related to a
  
   web portal
  
  .
  

    [67]
   


  Currently known as "
  
   Microsoft Rewards
  
  ",
  

    [68]
   

  launched by Microsoft in September 2010, it provides credits to users through regular Bing searches and special promotions.
  

    [69]
   

  These credits are then redeemed for various products including electronics, gift cards, sweepstakes, and charitable donations.
  

    [70]
   

  Users are given either Member, Silver or Gold status at one given time based on how frequent they use the program.
  

    [71]
   

  However, Microsoft has modified it to only two levels, Level 1 and Level 2. Level 1 is similar to 'Member' and Level 2 is similar to 'Gold' of the previous Bing Rewards. Initially, participants were required to download and use the Bing Bar for
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  in order to earn credits; however, this is no longer the case, and the service now works with all desktop browsers.
  

    [72]
   

  The Bing Rewards program is similar to two earlier services, SearchPerks! and
  
   Bing Cashback
  
  , which have now been discontinued.
 
  During the episode of
  

    The Colbert Report
   

  that aired on June 8, 2010,
  
   Stephen Colbert
  
  stated that Microsoft would donate $2,500 to help clean up the
  
   Gulf oil spill
  
  each time he mentioned the word "Bing" on air. Colbert mostly mentioned Bing in out-of-context situations, such as
  
   Bing Crosby
  
  and
  
   Bing cherries
  
  . By the end of the show, Colbert had said the word 40 times, for a total donation of $100,000. Colbert poked fun at their rivalry with Google, stating "Bing is a great website for doing Internet searches. I know that, because I Googled it."
  

    [73]
   



    [74]
   


  Bing was added into the list of search engines available in
  
   Opera browser
  
  from v10.6, but
  
   Google
  
  remained the default search engine.
  

    [75]
   


   Mozilla Firefox
  
  made a deal with Microsoft to jointly release
  
   "Firefox with Bing"
  
  , an edition of Firefox where Bing has replaced Google as the default search engine.
  

    [76]
   



    [77]
   

  The standard edition of Firefox has Google as its default search engine, but has included Bing in its list of search providers since Firefox version 4.0.
  

    [78]
   


  In addition, Microsoft paid
  
   Verizon Wireless
  
  $550 million USD
  

    [79]
   

  to use Bing as the default search provider on Verizon's BlackBerry and have Verizon "turn off" (via BlackBerry service books) the other search providers available. Users could still access other search engines via the mobile browser.
  

    [80]
   


  In 2012, a Bing marketing campaign asked the public which search engine they believed was better when its results were presented without branding, similar to the
  
   Pepsi Challenge
  
  in the 1970s.
  

    [81]
   



    [82]
   

  This poll was nicknamed "Bing It On".
  

    [83]
   



    [84]
   

  Microsoft presented a study of almost 1,000 people
  

    [85]
   

  which showed that 57% of participants in such a test preferred Bing's results, with only 30% preferring Google.
  

    [86]
   


  Bing censors results for "adult" search terms for some regions, including India, People's Republic of China, Germany and Arab countries
  

    [87]
   

  where required by local laws.
  

    [88]
   

  However, Bing allows users to change their country or region preference to somewhere without restrictions, such as the United States, United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland.
 
  Microsoft has been criticized for censoring Bing search results to queries made in
  
   simplified Chinese characters
  
  , used in
  
   mainland China
  
  . This is done to comply with the censorship requirements of the
  
   government in China
  
  .
  

    [89]
   

  Microsoft has not indicated a willingness to stop censoring search results in simplified Chinese characters in the wake of Google's decision to do so.
  

    [90]
   

  All simplified Chinese searches in Bing are censored regardless of the user's country.
  

    [91]
   


  On February 20, 2017, Bing agreed to a voluntary United Kingdom code of practice obligating it to demote links to copyright-infringing content in its search results.
  

    [92]
   



    [93]
   


  Bing has been criticized for being slower to index websites than Google. It has also been criticized for not indexing some websites at all.
  

    [94]
   



    [95]
   


  Bing has been criticized by competitor Google for utilizing user input via Internet Explorer, the Bing Toolbar, or
  
   Suggested Sites
  
  , to add results to Bing. After discovering in October 2010 that Bing appeared to be imitating Google's auto-correct results for a misspelling, despite not actually fixing the spelling of the term, Google set up a
  
   honeypot
  
  , configuring the Google search engine to return specific unrelated results for 100 nonsensical queries such as
  
   hiybbprqag
  
  .
  

    [96]
   

  Over the next couple of weeks, Google engineers entered the search term into Google, while using Microsoft Internet Explorer, with the Bing Toolbar installed and the optional Suggested Sites enabled. In 9 out of the 100 queries, Bing later started returning the same results as Google, despite the only apparent connection between the result and search term being that Google's results connected the two.
  

    [97]
   



    [98]
   


  Microsoft's response to this issue, coming from a company's spokesperson, was: "We do not copy Google's results." Bing's Vice President, Harry Shum, later reiterated that the search result data Google claimed that Bing copied had in fact come from Bing's very own users. Shum further wrote that "we use over 1,000 different signals and features in our ranking algorithm. A small piece of that is clickstream data we get from some of our customers, who opt into sharing anonymous data as they navigate the web in order to help us improve the experience for all users."
  

    [99]
   

  Microsoft commented that clickstream data from customers who had opted in was collected, but said that it was just a small piece of over 1000 signals used in their ranking algorithm, and that their intention was to learn from their collective customers. They stated that Bing was not intended to be a duplicate of any existing search engines.
