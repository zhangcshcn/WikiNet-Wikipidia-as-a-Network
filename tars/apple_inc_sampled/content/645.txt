  The stock was added to the
  
   New York Stock Exchange
  
  on April 6, 1986,
  

    [6]
   

  and was also listed on the
  
   S&P 500
  
  index.
 
  EMC had over 70,000 employees and was the world’s largest provider of data-storage systems by market share, competing against
  
   NetApp
  
  ,
  
   IBM
  
  ,
  
   Hewlett Packard Enterprise
  
  , and
  
   Hitachi Data Systems
  
  (arranged in descending order of external data-storage market share).

   Joseph M. Tucci
  
  had served as EMC's chief executive since January 2001 and chairman of the board of directors since January 2006; he joined the company in 2000 as president and chief operating officer.
  

    [8]
   

  Tucci was also chairman of the board of
  
   VMware
  
  Corporation
  

    [8]
   

  and chairman of the board of
  
   Pivotal Software
  
  , which are partially owned by EMC.
  

    [9]
   

  On October 12, 2015,
  
   Dell Inc.
  
  announced that it would acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion—the largest-ever acquisition in the technology industry.
  

    [10]
   



    [11]
   



    [12]
   

  The merger closed on September 7, 2016. EMC has been renamed to Dell EMC as a result of the merger.
  

    [13]
   

  The full form of former name EMC2 is Egan, Marino, Connolly & Curley.
 


  EMC, founded in 1979 by
  
   Richard Egan
  
  and
  
   Roger Marino
  
  (the E and M in EMC),
  

    [14]
   

  introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the
  
   Prime Computer
  
  in 1981
  

    [15]
   



    [16]
   

  and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other
  
   computer data storage
  
  types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the
  
   Symmetrix
  
  , in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.
  

    [17]
   



   Michael Ruettgers
  
  joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.
  

    [18]
   

  Under Ruettgers’ leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.
  

    [19]
   

  Ruettgers was named one of
  

    BusinessWeek
   


   '
  
  s "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by
  

    Worth
   

  magazine; and one of
  

    Network World

  s "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".
  

    [19]
   


  In 2001, Joe Tucci was named chief executive officer of EMC.
  

    [20]
   

  He has been credited with transforming EMC's business model from a focus on high-end storage platforms to a portfolio of platforms, software, and services that enable organizations to deliver IT as a service through cloud computing.
  

    [20]
   

  Under Tucci's leadership, EMC grew to $21.7 billion in revenues in 2012.
  

    [21]
   


  In 2009, EMC and
  
   Cisco
  
  , with investments from VMware and
  
   Intel
  
  , formed a joint venture called
  
   VCE
  
  to develop products and services for the converged infrastructure and cloud computing markets.
  

    [22]
   


  EMC announced its 450,000 square foot Center of Excellence (COE) in
  
   Durham, North Carolina
  
  in 2011.

  The COE houses a virtualized data center and includes 130,000 square feet of global research and development labs. The company also has COEs in India, China, Egypt, Israel, Ireland, Russia and Draper, Utah, USA which perform engineering, research and development, customer, and translation services for EMC business units.
  

    [23]
   


  In 2013, EMC launched a new company named Pivotal.
  

    [24]
   

  Led by
  
   Paul Maritz
  
  , the organization combines technologies from VMware and EMC and is focused on delivering Platform-as-a-Service products.
  

    [24]
   


  EMC has been growing in part through aggressively making acquisitions of small companies, and starting to bring those products to market.
  

    [25]
   


  On October 12, 2015,
  
   Dell Inc.
  
  announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. Dell CEO
  
   Michael Dell
  
  explained that the purchase was meant to "evolve the company into the most relevant areas where IT is moving", combining Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business. The deal is structured so that Dell will pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of
  
   tracking stock
  
  in VMware.

   IDC
  
  “measuring and characterizing all the digital data created, replicated, and consumed worldwide in a single year.”
  

    [101]
   

  The Digital Universe 2012 report anticipates that "during the next eight years, the amount of digital data produced will exceed 40 zettabytes, which is the equivalent of 5,200 GB of data for every man, woman and child on Earth. To hit that figure, all data is expected to double every two years through 2020."
  

    [102]

    [117]
   



   RSA Security
  
  , the security division of EMC, has received widespread criticism for accepting $10 million in a secret deal with
  
   NSA
  
  in 2004 to make
  
   Dual_EC_DRBG
  
  the default
  
   cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator
  
  in its prominent
  
   BSAFE
  
  cryptography library, and for continuing to use it until 2013.
  

    [118]
   

  Dual_EC_DRBG had been suspected since 2007 of containing a
  
   kleptographic
  
  backdoor designed by NSA. This was confirmed in a 2013
  
   New York Times
  
  article following the
  
   Snowden leak
  
  .
  

    [119]
   

  The standard
  
   FIPS
  
  version of Dual_EC_DRBG (which RSA Security implemented) was theoretically and empirically shown to be insecure in 2006 and 2007 (even aside from the backdoor); following discoveries by Dan Shumow and
  
   Niels Ferguson
  
  in 2007, prominent security expert
  
   Bruce Schneier
  
  published an article in
  

    Wired
   
   magazine
  
  titled "
  
   Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard?
  
  ".
  

    [120]
   

  Though Dual_EC_DRBG was highly suspect after 2007, its usage in EMC's BSAFE was not widely known until the 2013
  
   New York Times
  
  article brought it back into the spotlight. At the 2014
  
   RSA Conference
  
  , RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello defended RSA Security's choice to keep using Dual_EC_DRBG until
  
   NIST
  
  issued new guidance in 2013. He claimed that NIST only issued the guidance stop using the algorithm "when it became possible that concerns raised in 2007 might have merit".
