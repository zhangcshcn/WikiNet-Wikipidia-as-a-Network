   Apple Lossless
  
  , also known as
  
   Apple Lossless Audio Codec
  
  (
  
   ALAC
  
  ), or
  
   Apple Lossless Encoder
  
  (
  
   ALE
  
  ), is an
  
   audio coding format
  
  , and its reference
  
   audio codec
  
  implementation, developed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  for
  
   lossless data compression
  
  of digital
  
   music
  
  . After initially keeping it
  
   proprietary
  
  from its inception in 2004, in late 2011 Apple made the codec available
  
   open source
  
  and
  
   royalty-free
  
  . Traditionally, Apple has referred to the codec as
  
   Apple Lossless
  
  , though more recently they have begun to use the abbreviated term
  
   ALAC
  
  when referring to the codec.

  Apple Lossless supports up to 8 channels of audio at 16, 20, 24 and 32 bit depth with a maximum sample rate of 384kHz. Apple Lossless data is stored within an
  
   MP4
  

   container
  
  with the
  
   filename extension
  


    .m4a
   

  . This extension is also used by Apple for lossy AAC audio data in an MP4 container (same container, different audio encoding). However, Apple Lossless is not a variant of
  
   AAC
  
  (which is a lossy format), but rather a distinct lossless format that uses
  
   linear prediction
  
  similar to other lossless codecs. These other lossless codecs, such as
  
   FLAC
  
  and
  
   Shorten
  
  , are not natively supported by Apple's
  
   iTunes
  
  software (either the Mac OS or Windows versions) or by
  
   iOS devices
  
  , so users of iTunes software who want to use a lossless format which allows the addition of
  
   metadata
  
  (unlike
  
   WAV
  
  /
  
   AIFF
  
  or other PCM-type formats, where
  
   metadata is usually ignored
  
  ) have to use ALAC.
  

    [2]
   

  All current iOS devices can play ALACâ€“encoded files. ALAC also does not use any
  
   DRM
  
  scheme; but by the nature of the MP4
  
   container
  
  , it is feasible that DRM could be applied to ALAC much in the same way it is applied to files in other QuickTime containers.

  According to Apple, audio files compressed with its lossless codec will use up "about half the storage space" that the uncompressed data would require. Testers using a selection of music have found that compressed files are about 40% to 60% the size of the originals depending on the kind of music, which is similar to other lossless formats.

  Furthermore, compared to some other formats, it is not as difficult to decode, making it practical for a limited-power device, such as older
  
   iOS
  
  devices.

  Partly because of the use of an MP4 container, Apple Lossless does not contain integrated error checking.
  

    [7]
   


  While not nearly as common, the ALAC format can also use the
  
   .CAF
  
  file type container.
 
  The software for encoding into ALAC files, Apple Lossless
  
   Encoder
  
  , was introduced into the Mac OS X
  
   Core Audio
  
  framework on April 28, 2004 together with the
  
   QuickTime
  
  6.5.1 update; thus making it available in
  
   iTunes
  
  since version 4.5 and above.

  The codec is also used in the
  
   AirPort
  
  and
  
   AirPlay
  
  implementation.
 
  The Apple Lossless Encoder (and decoder) were released as open source software under the
  
   Apache License
  
  version 2.0 on October 27, 2011,

  however an independent reverse-engineered open-source encoder and decoder were already available before the release.
 
  David Hammerton and
  
   Cody Brocious
  
  have analyzed and decoded this codec without any documents on the format. On March 5, 2005, Hammerton published a simple
  
   open source
  
  decoder in the programming language
  
   C
  
  on the basis of the
  
   reverse engineering
  
  work.

  The open source library
  
   libavcodec
  
  incorporates both a decoder and an encoder for Apple Lossless format, which means that media players based on that library (including
  
   VLC media player
  
  and
  
   MPlayer
  
  , as well as many media center applications for
  
   home theater computers
  
  , such as
  
   Plex
  
  ,
  
   XBMC
  
  , and
  
   Boxee
  
  ) are able to play Apple Lossless files. The library was subsequently optimized for ARM processors and included in
  
   Rockbox
  
  .
  
   Foobar2000
  
  will also play Apple Lossless files as will
  
   JRiver Media Center
  
  and BitPerfect.
