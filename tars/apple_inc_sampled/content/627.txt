    [ˈl̪imʲɨnʲəx]
   

  ) is a city in
  
   county Limerick
  
  , Ireland. It is located in the
  
   Mid-West Region
  
  and is also part of the
  
   province
  
  of
  
   Munster
  
  .
  
   Limerick City and County Council
  
  is the
  
   local authority
  
  for the city. The city lies on the
  
   River Shannon
  
  , with the historic core of the city located on
  
   King's Island
  
  , which is bounded by the Shannon and the
  
   Abbey River
  
  . Limerick is also located at the head of the
  
   Shannon Estuary
  
  where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. With a population of 94,192 (2016 census), Limerick is the
  
   third most populous
  
  urban area in the state, and the
  
   fourth most populous
  
  city on the
  
   island of Ireland
  
  .
 


  There are 102,161 people living in the Limerick City Metropolitan District.
  

    [6]
   

  On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards
  
   Patrickswell
  
  in the west and
  
   Castleconnell
  
  in the east.
  

    [7]
   

  The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within
  
   County Clare
  
  . When included this increases the overall city and metropolitan area by a further 5,000 with a combined total population of 107,161.
  

    [8]
   

  Limerick is one of the constituent cities of the
  
   Cork–Limerick–Galway corridor
  
  which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the
  
   River Shannon
  
  with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the
  
   Golden Vale
  
  , an area of rich
  
   pastureland
  
  . Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland and it is particularly noted for
  
   Limerick Ham
  
  .
 

   Luimneach
  
  originally referred to the general area along the banks of the
  
   Shannon Estuary
  
  known as
  
   Loch Luimnigh
  
  . The earliest settlement in the city,
  
   Inis Sibhtonn
  
  , was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called
  
   Inis an Ghaill Duibh
  
  , "The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island". The name is recorded in
  
   Viking
  
  sources as
  
   Hlymrekr
  
  .
 
  The city dates from 812 which is the earliest probable settlement; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called "Regia" at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by St. Patrick in 434 to baptise an Eóganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number.
  

    [9]
   

  The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as
  
   King John's Castle
  
  and
  
   St Mary's Cathedral
  
  .
  

    [10]
   


  In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the
  
   Kingdom of Thomond
  
  which corresponds to the present day Mid West Region however, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was
  
   Brian Boru
  
  , ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge &
  
   Thomond Park
  
  .
 
  Limerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge
  
   Luke Gernon
  
  , a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: "lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in
  
   Oxford
  
  ".
  

    [11]
   


  During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by
  
   Oliver Cromwell
  
  in 1651 and twice by
  
   the Williamites
  
  in the 1690s. The
  
   Treaty of Limerick
  
  ended the
  
   Williamite war in Ireland
  
  which was fought between supporters of the Catholic
  
   King James II
  
  (Jacobites) and the Protestant
  
   King William of Orange
  
  (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to
  
   William and Mary
  
  . The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant
  
   Irish Parliament
  
  which rather updated the
  
   Penal Laws
  
  against Catholics which had major implications for
  
   Irish history
  
  . Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: Urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (An ancient city well studied in the arts of war).
 
  The peace times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th Century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the
  
   Golden Vale
  
  , to Britain and America.
  

    [12]
   

  This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as
  
   Georgian Limerick
  
  began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of fine
  
   Georgian
  
  townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The
  
   Waterford and Limerick Railway
  
  linked the city to the
  
   Dublin–Cork railway line
  
  in 1848 and to
  
   Waterford
  
  in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications. However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the
  
   French Revolution
  
  and Napoleonic eras, and following the
  
   Act of Union 1800
  
  , and the impact of the
  
   Great Irish Famine
  
  of 1848 caused much of the 19th Century to be a more troubled period.
 
  The
  
   Limerick boycott
  
  was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the twentieth century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father
  
   John Creagh
  
  .
 
  During the
  
   Irish War of Independence
  
  , the
  
   Limerick Soviet
  
  was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the
  
   British Army
  
  's declaration of a "Special Military Area" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.
 
  By the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  (located 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the
  
   Shannon Free Zone
  
  which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of
  
   NIHE Limerick
  
  in 1969 which eventually became the
  
   University of Limerick
  
  in 1989.
 
  The local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of
  
   Limerick City and County Council
  
  . The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected
  
   ward
  

   Councillors
  
  with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. The current Cathaoirleach is Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area.
  

    [19]
   

  The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea.
  

    [20]
   

  Former well-known mayors include TDs
  
   Donogh O'Malley
  
  ,
  
   Stephen Coughlan
  
  ,
  
   Michael Lipper
  
  ,
  
   Jim Kemmy
  
  and
  
   Jan O'Sullivan
  
  .
  

    [21]
   


  Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as
  
   Limerick City Council
  
  . The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by
  
   Dublin City Council
  
  . In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with
  
   Limerick County Council
  
  . The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the
  
   Local Government Reform Act 2014
  
  .
  

    [22]
   


  By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; however, the city boundary was only altered slightly but still never reflected the overall city urban area. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000.
  

    [23]
   

  The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as
  
   Dooradoyle
  
  ,
  
   Castletroy
  
  – including the
  
   University
  
  , Gouldavoher, and
  
   Raheen
  
  were continually administered to by
  
   Limerick County Council
  
  until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and
  
   Parteen
  
  to the north of the city are governed by
  
   Clare County Council
  
  .
 
  Following the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as
  
   Patrickswell
  
  and
  
   Castleconnell
  
  . The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County.
  

    [24]
   

  The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively

  For national
  
   Dáil
  
  elections Limerick City is in the
  
   Limerick City
  
  constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the
  
   Constituency Commission
  
  and the subsequent
  
   Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009
  
  . This changed the electoral boundaries from
  
   Limerick East
  
  and
  
   Limerick West
  
  to
  
   Limerick City
  
  and
  
   Limerick
  
  . Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of
  
   Castletroy
  
  and as far east as
  
   Castleconnell
  
  . It also includes part of south
  
   County Clare
  
  . The
  
   Limerick
  
  county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For
  
   European parliament
  
  elections Limerick is in
  
   South Ireland
  
  .
 
  Limerick's climate is classified as
  
   temperate oceanic
  
  (
  
   Köppen
  

   Cfb
  
  ). Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  , 20 kilometres west of the city in
  
   County Clare
  
  . Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 °C (68 °F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 °C (37 °F). The highest temperature recorded was 31.6 °C (88.9 °F) in 1995, and the lowest −11.4 °C (11.5 °F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 59 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 19 days of hail and 8 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.
 
  In 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural
  
   National City of Culture
  
  , with a wide variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at various locations around the city throughout the entire year.
 
  The
  
   Limerick City Gallery of Art
  
  on
  
   Pery Square
  
  is the city's chief venue for
  
   contemporary art
  
  exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of
  
   Irish art
  
  , which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is
  
   EVA International
  
  , Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art.
  

    [28]
   

  EVA International (formerly EV+A – Exhibition of Visual+ Art) is curated by a new guest curator every two years and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists. The centre of the exhibition is the Limerick City Gallery of Art, but EVA generally uses numerous other venues throughout the city including public spaces.
 
  The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the
  
   Mary Immaculate College
  
  campus on 30 October 2012. The modern venue is able to host theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.

  The
  
   Belltable Arts Centre
  
  on
  
   O'Connell Street
  
  (in liquidation as of February 2013)
  

    [30]
   

  hosts for local playwriting and drama. Mike Finn's numerous plays have been successful, including
  
   Pigtown
  
  , set around a century of the city's history, and
  
   Shock and Awe
  
  , an energetic retelling of
  
   Homer
  
  's
  
   Iliad
  
  . The University Concert Hall located in
  
   UL
  
  is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including "The Umbrella Project".
 
  Limerick is also well catered for when it comes to literature. The Limerick Writers' Centre was established in 2008 and is responsible for a broad range writing activities in the city. Limerick has long been famous for its passion for arts, culture and heritage and you only have to look at some of its natives, which include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O’Brien, Michael Curtin and lately Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Limerick poets have also contributed widely to its literary heritage with Michael Hogan, Desmond O’Grady, John Liddy…the list goes on and on, proving that literature and writing is one of the major creative activities that the Treaty City can be proud of.
 
  Other active Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to
  
   St John's Cathedral
  
  , as a performance space); the
  
   Fresh Film Festival
  
  , which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7–18 years) from all over Ireland; Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production. It received attention in the national media with its 2005 production of
  

    Romeo and Juliet
   

  , which made comparisons between
  
   the ongoing feud
  
  in the city with that of the Montagus and the Capulets in the play.
 
  The
  
   Irish Chamber Orchestra
  
  and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the
  
   University of Limerick
  
  . The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that frequently hosts visiting performers. The city has an active music scene, which has produced bands such as
  
   The Cranberries
  
  and guitarist
  
   Noel Hogan
  
  's MonoBand,
  
   The Hitchers
  
  and many more. World-renowned electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as
  
   Aphex Twin
  
  , was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art of all styles.
 
  Limerick is also home to comedians
  
   The Rubberbandits
  
  , D'Unbelievables (
  
   Pat Shortt
  
  and
  
   Jon Kenny
  
  ) and
  
   Karl Spain
  
  . Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road has two venues specialising in live music; an upstairs venue which tends to accommodate comedians and
  
   folk
  
  and
  
   jazz
  
  acts, and a much larger warehouse venue holding 400, which tends to stage more popular (usually rock) acts, both national and international. Dance music is catered for at Baker Place which holds mainly local underground nights and Trinity Rooms which has regularly hosts big names like Hot Chip, Groove Armada, DJ Yoda and Jazzy Jeff alongside more cutting-edge names like Dan Le Sac, Christian Smith, and Missill.
 
  The city is the setting for
  
   Frank McCourt
  
  's memoir
  

    Angela's Ashes
   

  and the
  
   film adaptation
  
  . The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains many artefacts from the book, it also houses Frank's Ashes.
  

    [31]
   

  It is the setting for the contemporary coming-of-age drama
  

    Cowboys & Angels
   

  and Robert Cunningham's
  
   Somebody's Daughter]
  
  , which was shot in various locations around the city and had its premiere in King John's Castle in July 2004.

  Limerick City is a main tourist destination, only a 15-minute drive from
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  . Tourist attractions of architectural and historical note in the city centre include
  
   Limerick City Museum
  
  ,
  
   King John's Castle
  
  (1212),
  
   St Mary's Cathedral
  
  (1168), the
  
   Hunt Museum
  
  , the
  
   University of Limerick
  
  , Georgian houses and gardens and the
  
   Treaty Stone
  
  . There are several seasonal tours (
  
   Angela's Ashes
  
  walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour and boat tours along the
  
   River Shannon
  
  ).
 
  The city centre is divided between the traditional areas of "English Town" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; "Irish Town", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called "
  
   Newtown Pery
  
  ".
  

    [38]
   

  Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the
  
   Act of Union
  
  and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a
  
   grid plan
  
  . The
  
   Limerick City Museum
  
  (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.
  

    [39]
   


  The Georgian core of the city, with fine
  
   Georgian architecture
  
  in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before Independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other architectural buildings of architectural note in the city are
  
   St John's Cathedral
  
  , designed by the notable Victorian architect,
  
   Philip Charles Hardwick
  
  . St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).
  

    [40]
   

  One of Ireland's most celebrated museums, the
  
   Hunt Museum
  
  , is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house an internationally important collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by
  
   John and Gertrude Hunt
  
  during their lifetimes. On display are the 9th century Antrim Cross, a sketch by
  
   Picasso
  
  and a bronze sculpture of a horse, said to be from a design by
  
   Leonardo da Vinci
  
  .
 
  The main park in Limerick is the
  
   People's Park
  
  which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820–1832) and has a large collection of mature
  
   deciduous
  
  and evergreen trees.
 
  Limerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/
  
   Caherdavin
  
  ), Dublin (
  
   Castletroy
  
  and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).
 
  Currently tourism is growing, with over 1,000 new beds being opened in the city in 2006 thanks to the opening of five new hotels. The city provides visitors with "Street Ambassadors", people designated to help others around and make their stay more enjoyable. Limerick City has a vibrant nightlife, with numerous nightclubs and pubs giving a range of drinking experiences from the warm and cosy to cutting edge. Dolan's Warehouse is a popular small concert venue that hosts many local, national and international folk, indie, jazz and rock acts. It is also an established venue for traditional Irish music.
 
  In County Limerick,
  
   Adare
  
  village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also popular attractions.
  
   Bunratty Castle
  
  in
  
   Co. Clare
  
  is another local attraction of national significance. It is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the
  
   Campbell Islands
  
  of New Zealand.

  Limerick is officially the third largest city in Ireland (after
  
   Dublin
  
  and
  
   Cork
  
  ) with a population of 102,161 people according to the 2011 census carried out by the
  
   CSO
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards.
  

    [42]
   

  The population of the Limerick
  
   Larger Urban Zone
  
  as defined by the
  
   EU
  
  is 162,413.
  

    [3]
   

  Limerick has a notably ethnically diverse population, and a large immigrant community, which saw especially rapid growth during the
  
   Celtic Tiger
  
  and the following decade. The Polish community is the second largest outside of Dublin, with an estimated 10,000 living and working in the city. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007.
  

    [43]
   

  The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.
  

    [44]
   


  Limerick has a large stock of
  
   local authority
  
  housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was
  
   local authority
  
  , which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.
  

    [45]
   


  Limerick is at the heart of the region dubbed "
  
   the Midwest
  
  ". Also known as the "Shannon Region", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses
  
   County Limerick
  
  ,
  
   County Clare
  
  , North
  
   County Tipperary
  
  , Northwest
  
   County Kerry
  
  and south
  
   Offaly
  
  , with its focal point centered on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.
 
  The area is possibly the main economic region outside of
  
   Dublin
  
  and
  
   Cork
  
  . Its economic success has been driven in part by the
  
   University of Limerick
  
  ,
  
   Limerick Institute of Technology
  
  ,
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  in Co. Clare and
  
   Shannon Development
  
  (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006
  

    [update]
   

  Shannon Development is mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties.
  
   Limerick Chamber of Commerce
  
  , the voice of business in the region, is a thriving organisation. Limerick Chamber celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.
 
  Historically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the
  
   Golden Vale
  
  as well as produce from the surrounding counties.
  

    [12]
   

  The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its Bacon Industry however this went into decline in the mid 20th Century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite
  
   King John's Castle
  
  and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men.
  

    [46]
   

  The boat most commonly used was the
  
   Gandelow
  
  which was also used as a small
  
   Lighter (barge)
  
  to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port.
  

    [47]
   

  In the 1920s the construction of a dam at
  
   Ardnacrusha
  
  severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish.
  

    [48]
   

  By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.
  

    [49]
   


  In line with the changing economic landscape in Ireland, many multinational companies are based in Limerick.
  
   Dell
  
  had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland.
  

    [50]
   

  The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000–60,000 units per day for export to the
  
   EMEA
  
  . Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support.
  

    [51]
   


   Analog Devices
  
  has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people.
  
   Johnson & Johnson
  
  subsidiary
  
   Vistakon
  
  (the world's largest manufacturer of
  
   contact lenses
  
  ) has a large facility in
  
   Castletroy
  
  in the
  
   National Technology Park
  
  and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the
  
   National Technology Park
  
  .
 
  The recent economic recession in Ireland had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP.
  

    [52]
   

  The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised a massive investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.
  

    [45]
   


  The service industry is an important employer in the city. The
  

    Crescent Shopping Centre
   

  is the premier shopping area of the city. It is located in
  
   Dooradoyle
  
  about 3 km south of the city centre. It is the largest shopping centre in Ireland (outside of Dublin) and the largest in the province of Munster. It has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. Regular bus services run from the city centre to the Crescent Shopping Centre. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern
  
   high street
  
  stores.
  
   Cruises Street
  
  is one of the main shopping streets.
  
   O'Connell Street
  
  ,
  
   William Street
  
  ,
  
   Bedford Row
  
  &
  
   Thomas Street)
  
  are also the main retail streets within the city. The city centre has seen major works on remodelling & pedestrianisation in recent years to improve its appearance. Work has completed on pedestrianising Bedford Row, Thomas Street & parts of Catherine Street as well as widening footpaths on William Street. Work is due to begin shortly on the pedestrianisation of O'Connell Street between William Street & Roches Street. It is hoped the work will make the city centre more attractive for shoppers & visitors which has seen some serious decline over the past decade as the retail offering in the city centre has consistently lagged behind that of the suburban shopping centres. The result has been a severe reduction of footfall in the city centre which in turn has resulted in the closure of many city centre retail businesses which accelerated from recession of 2008 onwards.

  During the
  
   Celtic Tiger
  
  years a number of shopping centres & retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. The 'Crescent Shopping Centre' expanded in the early 2000s to become one of the largest in Ireland. The 'Jetland Shopping Centre' in
  
   Caherdavin
  
  opened in 2005. Its main anchor is
  
   Dunnes Stores
  
  . The
  
   Childers Road Retail Park
  
  & the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the
  
   Coonagh
  
  Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. The
  
   Opera Centre
  
  was also a retail development for the city centre but is unlikely to go ahead.
 

   The Milk Market
  
  located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products. The market is governed by Limerick Market Trustees and is one of the oldest markets run in the country. It is open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday with the Saturday market acting as the flagship and is the most popular market. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010.
 
  The Milk Market Project won the 2011
  
   Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland
  
  (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'. Local architects Healy & Partners designed the project. Also involved were local civil and structural engineers Dennany Reidy Associates.

  Local public transport is provided by several companies.
  
   Bus Éireann
  
  , Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a range of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. A new enhanced city bus network was introduced in Limerick City on Sunday 4 December.
  

    [54]
   

  A new route was introuced to the network called 304A that connects Raheen and Monaleen to the centre. Later services on all routes were also introduced with the last daily departure from the city centre at 23.30.
 
  The city bus service routes are now:
  

    [55]
   


  Routes 301-306 are operated by Bus Éireann. Routes 307 and 308 were originally run by Eurobus, but have now been taken over by Dublin Coach.
 
  Buses run to towns and villages in the county and to
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  . There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus Éireann's
  
   bus terminal
  
  adjoining
  
   Limerick Colbert railway station
  
  . These include hourly services to
  
   Dublin
  
  ,
  
   Cork
  
  &

  . There are also regular daily services to
  
   Waterford
  
  &
  
   Athlone
  
  and a daily service to London via the ferry from
  
   Rosslare Europort
  
  .
 
  There are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the
  
   M7
  
  express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis.
  

    [56]
   

  JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services and to
  
   Shannon Airport
  
  also from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway & Cork and operate from Henry Street.
 

   Iarnród Éireann
  
  's
  
   Limerick Colbert station
  
  is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services.
  
   Limerick railway station
  
  opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.
  

    [57]
   


  The following
  
   inter city
  
  routes are available from
  
   Limerick Colbert station
  
  :
 
  There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the
  
   Limerick Suburban Rail
  
  network:
 
  There are also a number of disused railway lines including the
  
   Limerick to
   
    Foynes
   

  line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ. This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick – Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near
  
   Rathkeale
  
  ) and
  
   Tralee
  
  .
 
  The
  
   Railway Procurement Agency
  
  has suggested that a tram system should be built in the city.

  Limerick's central location in the mid – west of Ireland means many important national primary routes converge on the city
  

    [59]
   

  . The
  
   M7
  
  (Dublin),
  
   N/M18
  
  (Galway, Ennis, Shannon),
  
   N/M20
  
  (Cork),
  
   N21
  
  (Tralee) and
  
   N24
  
  (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure has improved over the past decade with the completion of the southern ring road and
  
   Limerick Tunnel
  
  bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities is improving also with the completion of the
  
   M7
  
  motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis and Tuam - the final section is now expected to open in November 2017.
  

    [60]
   

  A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick.
 
  Historically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the
  
   Shannon
  
  , enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th Century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the
  
   Grand Canal
  
  in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey – Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at
  
   King's Island
  
  . Today
  
   the port
  
  is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road and is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary. It is a general purpose facility port. Plans to close the port and relocate all activity to the deepwater facility further downstream at
  
   Foynes
  
  have been abandoned. The plans included a major regeneration of the dockland area.
 
  Limerick is an important centre of higher education in Ireland.
 
  Technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the
  
   Limerick Athenaeum
  
  Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the
  
   Limerick Institute of Technology
  
  . The Society's aims included "the promotion of Literature, Science, Art and Music".
  

    [61]
   


  Today, Limerick is home to a number of higher-education institutions including the
  
   University of Limerick
  
  ,
  
   Limerick Institute of Technology
  
  and
  
   Mary Immaculate College
  
  and has a student population of over 20,000.
  

    [62]
   


  The University of Limerick (UL), has a student population of over 13,000, and is about 5 km east of the city centre in the suburb of
  
   Castletroy
  
  . It was established as the National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) in 1972, and in 1989 was the first university to be established since the foundation of the
  
   State
  
  in 1922. It is notable for its programs of engineering, information technology,
  
   materials science
  
  ,
  
   sports science
  
  , humanities, teacher education, social sciences and music. In 2007, the university opened a medical school. The Irish World Music Centre specialises in traditional music and dance, and UL is host to the
  
   Irish Chamber Orchestra
  
  . The campus includes a 50m Olympic-standard swimming complex, the first to be established in Ireland.

   Thomond College of Education, Limerick
  
  was a successful teacher training college for secondary level and was integrated into the university in 1991.
 
  Limerick Institute of Technology (LIT) has a student population of 7,000 and is a centre for undergraduate and postgraduate education in business, engineering, information technology, humanities, science and art education. The main campus is located at Moylish Park, about 3 kilometres north-west of the city centre, and the
  
   School of Art & Design
  
  is located on campuses at Clare Street and George's Quay. Additional facilities and outreach centres are located at O'Connell Street and in Ennis, Co. Clare and LIT has two campuses in Co. Tipperary, LIT Thurles and LIT Clonmel. These were formerly the campuses of the
  
   Tipperary Institute
  
  which merged with LIT in 2011.
  

    [66]
   


  LIT was originally established in 1852 as a School of Ornamental Art. In the mid-1970s it was incorporated as The Limerick College of Art, Commerce & Technology (CoACT) and achieved the designation of a Regional Technical College (RTC) in 1993 and finally an
  
   Institute of Technology
  
  in 1997. The Institute has a strong sporting ethos, which is not surprising given its location adjacent to
  
   Thomond Park
  
  and the
  
   Gaelic Grounds
  
  . It has a strong focus on business incubation, having operations in several enterprise centres:
  
   The National Franchise Centre
  
  ; Croom Community Enterprise Centre; Thurles Chamber Enterprise Centre (TCEC);
  
   The Hartnett Enterprise Acceleration Centre (HEAC)
  
  . Two further enterprise centres, the Enterprise and Research Centre, Clonmel and the Irish Fashion Incubator Limited (IFIL) will be added to its unique "Enterprise Ladder" in 2013. LIT is also home to the Millennium Theatre, a popular northside venue for shows and concerts.
 
  Mary Immaculate College is an education and arts college located just south-west of the city centre. The main focus is on the education of primary-level teachers.
 

   Griffith College Limerick
  
  (GCL) is a private college in Limerick. The college was established in 2006 when the Mid West Business Institute was acquired by Griffith College.

  The National Elite Swimming Club is based in The University of Limerick Arena.
 
  Similar to the rest of Ireland, basketball was a very popular sport in Limerick during the 1970s and 1980s, with up to four divisions in the men's and women's local leagues. It suffered a decline during the 1990s culminating in the complete demise of local league basketball in the city and surrounding areas. The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's in particular having a long history in the National Leagues. There has been somewhat of a revival in basketball in the city in recent years, particularly at underage level.
 
  Limerick is currently represented in the
  
   National Leagues
  
  by the men's
  
   UL Eagles
  
  team and the women's UL Aughinish team. They both play their home games at the 2,500 capacity University Arena at the University of Limerick. There are a number of other teams at school and club level, including St. Colm's, Limerick Lakers, Taste of Europe, Limerick Celtic and
  
   Limerick Lions
  
  .
 

   Limerick Cricket Club
  
  is a member of the Munster Cricket Union and plays in competitions organised by the Union. The club has in the past provided players for the
  
   Ireland national cricket team
  
  .
 
  Three rowing clubs are located in the city, namely Shannon Rowing Club, Saint Michaels Rowing Club and Athlunkard Boat Club. St Michael's member and Limerick native Sam Lynch won the World Championship gold medal in the Men's Lightweight Single Skulls in Lucerne in 2001, defending his title to take the gold again in Seville in 2002.
 
  Ireland's national sports of
  
   Hurling
  
  and
  
   Gaelic football
  
  are widely played in the city and its surrounding suburbs. Although
  
   Limerick
  
  has not won the
  
   All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship
  
  since 1973, it reached the finals in 1974, 1980, 1994, 1996 and 2007 and is one of the top four teams in the game, in terms of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships won. The county won successive All-Ireland Under-21 titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The county's GAA teams display the
  
   Sporting Limerick
  
  logo.

  Football is very popular in the city and has more players involved than in any other sport. The city is represented in the
  
   League of Ireland
  
  by
  
   Limerick FC
  
  . The club first joined the league in 1937 and has been involved since then, although there have been a number of variations of the club. Their most successful period was from the 1960s to the 1980s when they won 2 League of Ireland championships and two
  
   FAI Cups
  
  . The club played at
  
   The Market's Field
  
  until the mid-1980s when they controversially moved to a new venue. A period of declining fortunes and a nomadic existence followed.
  

    [81]
   

  The club is currently playing in the
  
   League of Ireland Premier Division
  
  , the top tier of Irish football. Limerick FC returned to The Market's Field on 5 June 2015, following the purchase of the venue by the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership (LEDP) from
  
   Bord na gCon
  
  , the Irish greyhound racing authority. The purchase was funded by a donation from the JP McManus Charitable Foundation.
