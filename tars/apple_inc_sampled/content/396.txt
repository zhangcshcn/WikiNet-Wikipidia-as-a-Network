   Daniel Kottke
  
  was a college friend of
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  and one of the first employees of
  
   Apple Inc.
  



  Kottke first met
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  when they were both undergraduates at
  
   Reed College
  
  in 1972.

  In 1974, Kottke and Jobs
  
   made a trek in search of spiritual enlightenment
  
  to
  
   India
  


    [2]
   

  to visit
  
   Neem Karoli Baba
  


    [3]
   

  at his
  
   Kainchi
  

   ashram
  
  . When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973.
  

    [4]
   

  Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of
  
   Haidakhan Babaji
  
  . In India, they spent a lot of time on bus rides from
  
   Delhi
  
  to
  
   Uttar Pradesh
  
  and
  
   Himachal Pradesh
  
  .

  After returning from India, Kottke transferred to
  
   Columbia College
  
  in 1975 as a literature and music major.
  

    [1]
   

  He stayed in touch with Jobs and they traveled together to fellow Reed College classmate
  
   Robert Friedland
  
  's
  

    All One Farm

  During his junior year at Columbia in 1976, Jobs asked Kottke to become involved in a hobbyist computer project where he assembled and tested the boards during the summer. He also arranged for Kottke to work "for an hourly rate part-time assembling circuit boards for a company called Call Computer" that didn't require technical expertise.
  

    [1]
   

  It was during that summer that Kottke realized his own interest in computers.
  

    [1]
   

  Kottke stated in an interview with
  
   KQED
  
  /
  
   PBS
  
  that both he and Jobs' sister Patty (who was also assembling boards while watching TV) were the first part-time employees of Apple, while
  
   Bill Fernandez
  
  was the first full-time employee.
  

    [1]
   


  In 1977, after graduating from Columbia, Kottke joined Apple as full-time employee #12.

    [6]
   

  It was at that time that Jobs, Kottke, and Jobs' girlfriend
  
   Chrisann Brennan
  
  shared a house near the Apple office in
  
   Cupertino
  
  .
  

    [7]
   


  Kottke spent an additional eight years with Apple debugging
  
   Apple II
  
  printed circuit boards and building
  
   Apple III
  
  and
  
   Macintosh
  
  prototypes as well as working on the design for the Macintosh keyboard. The Apple II gained a sizable amount of popularity, eventually becoming one of the best selling personal computers of the 1970s and early 1980s. Kottke was also one of the original members of the
  
   Macintosh
  
  development team and his signature can be found embossed on the internal wall of early production Macintosh computers.

  Steve Jobs, however, refused to grant Kottke stock in the new company, stating that he "will give him zero" (
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  would later give Daniel some of his own shares in Apple).
  

    [9]
   

  In her memoir of her life with Jobs, Chrisann Brennan states that she later asked Kottke about not receiving the stock options and that he replied: "Oh that [...] Steve had offered me a job in marketing [...] but I wasn’t interested in marketing because I had something like a fever to understand the technology [...] so I never pursued the marketing opportunity."
  

    [7]
   


  In addition, in 1982 when
  
   Time Magazine
  
  featured a major, but unflattering, profile of Jobs that actually made him cry, he publicly "berated" Kottke for confirming the fact to
  
   Time
  
  that he had a daughter,
  
   Lisa Brennan
  
  , whom he had basically abandoned.

  In an interview with
  

    Slashdot
   

  , Kottke states that
  
   Pirates of Silicon Valley
  
  was "a great movie. Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs. Just unbelievable. I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen." He also states that in the film there were "all these scenes of the garage where it’s like half a dozen people working, busily carrying things back and forth, and oscilloscopes" when he [Kottke] "was really the only person who worked in the garage. Woz would show up once a week with his latest to test it out, and Steve Jobs was on the phone a lot in the kitchen."

  In an interview with
  

    Slashdot
   

  , Kottke states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay for
  
   Jobs
  
  and notes that "Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair." He also said that the early versions of the screenplay "were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to
  
   Mike Markkula
  
  because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe."

  Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film.
  
   Bill Fernandez
  
  was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because "the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth." Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because "I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could."
  

    [10]
   


  In the same interview,
  
   Bill Fernandez
  
  and Kottke commented on the characterization of
  
   Rod Holt
  
  (portrayed by actor
  
   Ron Eldard
  
  ). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: "What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair […] he’s like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up."
  

    [10]
   

  Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), "thought it was hilarious."
  

    [10]
   

  As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, "Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn’t look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he’s wearing leathers."
  

    [10]
   

  Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, “Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? […] It seems to me that there’s a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there’s been to date.

  The TV show
  

    John Wants Answers
   

  took
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  , Kottke, and
  
   Andy Hertzfeld
  
  through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred.
  

    [11]
   


  In an interview with
  

    CNN
   

  , Kottke states that seeing the movie was a bit of a shock to him and that he enjoyed it very much. "It took me a few days after seeing the film ... I was surprised to see what a dominant character Lisa became. I found that very gratifying to see. It was very much a caricature ... [but] Aaron Sorkin did such a good job."
