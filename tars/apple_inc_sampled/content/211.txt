   Music visualization
  
  or
  
   music visualisation
  
  , a feature found in electronic music visualizers and
  
   media player
  

   software
  
  , generates animated
  
   imagery
  
  based on a piece of music. The imagery is usually generated and rendered in real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.
 
  Visualization techniques range from simple ones (e.g., a simulation of an
  
   oscilloscope
  
  display) to elaborate ones, which often include a plurality of
  
   composited
  
  effects. The changes in the music's
  
   loudness
  
  and
  
   frequency spectrum
  
  are among the properties used as input to the visualization.
 



   "Music visualization"
  
  can be defined, in contrast to previous existing pre-generated music plus visualization combinations (as for example
  
   music videos
  
  ), by its characteristic as being
  
   real-time
  
  generated. Another possible distinction is seen by some in the ability of some music visualization systems (such as Geiss'
  
   MilkDrop
  
  ) to create different visualizations for each song or audio every time the program is run, in contrast to other forms of music visualization (such as
  
   music videos
  
  or a
  
   laser lighting display
  
  ) which always show the same visualization.
 
  The first electronic music visualizer was the
  
   Atari Video Music
  
  introduced by
  
   Atari Inc.
  
  in 1976, and designed by the initiator of the home version of
  

    Pong
   

  , Robert Brown. The idea was to create a visual exploration that could be implemented into a
  
   Hi-Fi
  
  stereo system. It is described in
  

    US 4081829
   





  . In
  
   Great Britain
  
  music visualization was first pioneered by
  
   Fred Judd
  
  .
 
  Music and audio players were available on early home computers,
  
   Sound to Light Generator
  
  (1985, Infinite Software) used the ZX Spectrum's cassette player for example.
  

    [1]
   

  The 1984 movie
  
   Electric Dreams
  
  prominently made use of one, although as a pre-generated effect, rather than calculated in
  
   real-time
  
  .
 
  For
  
   PC
  
  /
  
   DOS
  
  one of the first modern music visualization programs was the
  
   open-source
  
  , multi-platform
  

    Cthugha
   

  in 1993. In the 1990s the emerging
  
   demo
  
  and
  
   tracker music
  
  scene pioneered the real-time technics for music visualization on the PC platform; resulting examples are
  
   Cubic player
  
  (1994),

   Inertia Player
  
  (1995)
  

    [3]
   

  or in general their real-time generated
  
   Demos
  
  .

  Subsequently, PC computer music visualization became widespread in the mid to late 1990s as applications such as
  

    Winamp
   

  (1997),
  

    Audion
   

  (1999), and
  

    SoundJam
   

  (2000). By 1999, there were several dozen
  
   freeware
  
  non-trivial music visualizers in distribution. In particular,
  

    MilkDrop
   

  (2001) and its predecessor "geiss-plugin" (1998) by
  
   Ryan Geiss
  
  ,
  
   G-Force
  
  by
  
   Andy O'Meara
  
  , and
  
   AVS
  
  (2000) by
  
   Nullsoft
  
  became popular music visualizations. AVS is part of
  
   Winamp
  
  and has been recently
  
   open-sourced
  
  ,
  

    [6]
   

  and G-Force was licensed for use in
  
   iTunes
  


    [7]
   

  and
  
   Windows Media Center
  

   [

  and is presently the flagship product for Andy O'Meara's software startup company,
  
   SoundSpectrum
  
  .
 
  With the increasing popularity of
  
   virtual reality
  
  , several start ups have begun working on music visualization although reception has been mixed
  

    [8]
   

  with one informal poll finding that only 33% of respondents were interested in music visualization for VR.
