  The
  
   iPad 2
  
  is a
  
   tablet
  
  designed, developed and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  Compared to the first iPad, as the second device in the
  
   iPad
  
  line it gained a faster
  
   dual core
  

   A5 processor
  
  , a lighter build structure, and was the first iPad to feature VGA front-facing and
  
   720p
  
  rear-facing cameras designed for
  
   FaceTime
  
  video calling.
 
  The device was available initially with three storage sizes, 16, 32 and 64 GB and two varying connectivity options,
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  only or Wi-Fi and cellular. Each variation of the device is available with either a black or white front glass panel. However, upon the release of the
  
   3rd generation iPad
  
  , only the 16 GB variation with two connectivity options and two front color options was available.
 
  Apple unveiled the device on March 2, 2011.

  Upon the announcement of the iPad 2, the original model of the iPad was discontinued.
  

    [9]
   

  Sales of the iPad 2 online and at retail stores began in the United States on March 11.
  

    [10]
   

  It was then released in 25 other Oceanian, North American and Western European countries on March 25 and released in eleven Asian countries as well as one African country on April 29.
  

    [11]
   

  Subsequently, on May 6 and 27, the device was released in three South American, six Eastern European and three Asian countries.
 
  The device received mixed to positive reception from various blogs and publications. Although it was praised for its hardware improvement, such as the new
  
   Apple A5
  
  chip, the software restriction on the iPad 2 and
  
   iOS
  
  in general drew criticism from various technology commentators.
  

    [12]
   



    [13]
   

  The device sold well in its first month of sales with 2.4–2.6 million units sold and 11.12 million units were sold in the third quarter of 2011.
  

    [14]
   



    [15]
   


  A popular product, with a lower screen resolution and performance than the two
  
   Retina
  
  models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a
  
   die-shrunk
  
  version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed the core of the
  
   first iPad mini
  
  , which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the first and only iOS device to be able to do so.
 


  Apple sent invitations to journalists on February 23, 2011, for a media event on March 2.
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   

  On March 2, 2011, CEO
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  unveiled the device at the
  
   Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
  
  , despite being on medical leave.
  

    [8]
   

  Upon the announcement of the iPad 2, the original iPad was discontinued from sales online and at Apple authorized retail stores.
  

    [9]
   


  Apple began selling the iPad 2 on its website on March 11,
  

    [10]
   

  and in its U.S. retail stores at 5 pm local time on that date. Many stores in major cities, such as New York, sold out within hours.
  

    [18]
   

  Online shipping delays had increased to three to four weeks on Sunday and four to five weeks by Tuesday.
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   


  The iPad 2 was released internationally in 25 other countries on March 25, 2011. The countries included Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
  

    [21]
   


  The April 29, 2011 release date for Japan was postponed due to the
  
   earthquake and tsunami
  
  which struck the nation on March 11, 2011. The iPads were delayed due to the NAND flash storage chip used in the iPads being created by
  
   Toshiba
  
  , which was affected by the earthquake and tsunami thus resulting in the suspension of operations for an indefinite period of time.
  

    [22]
   

  The slowdown caused analysts to downgrade Apple's stock.
  

    [23]
   


  The iPad 2 was later released in Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and other countries including Japan on April 29, 2011.
  

    [11]
   

  It was then released in numerous other nations which include China, Estonia, Thailand, Brazil, Russia and Taiwan on two major release dates, May 6 and 27.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   


  The 32 and 64 GB models were discontinued on March 7, 2012, upon the introduction of the third generation iPad. The 16 GB Wi-Fi and 16 GB Wi-Fi + 3G models were discontinued on March 18, 2014.
  

    [26]
   


  In late March 2011, the iPad 2 was released alongside iOS 4.2.1, which primarily introduced FaceTime, Personal Hotspots and
  
   AirPlay
  
  support among other features. The iPad 2 is compatible with iOS 4.3, which introduced Airplay Mirroring and Home Sharing among other features.
  

    [27]
   

  On October 12, 2011, upon the release of the
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  , the iPad was upgradable to the iOS 5 firmware which brought over 200 new user features to iOS compatible devices including Notification Center, iMessage, Reminders, and an updated notifications system, using a new "banner" style instead of the previously used pop-up "alert" style.
  

    [28]
   


  The iPad 2 comes with several applications by default, including
  
   Safari
  
  , Mail, Photos, Video, Music, iTunes (store), Maps, Notes, Calendar,
  
   Photo Booth
  
  , and Contacts.
  

    [29]
   

  The
  
   App Store
  
  is also available as a default application, it enables users to download from a database of 800,000 applications,
  

    [30]
   

  the price of these applications is set by the developers. Like all
  
   iOS
  
  devices, the iPad 2 can sync music, videos, apps and photos with a Mac or PC using iTunes, although when using iOS 5 and later, the user does not have to connect the iPad to the computer.
  

    [31]
   


   iCloud
  
  also allows users to backup and sync their data with other compatible iOS devices via the internet. Game Center is available as a native social gaming platform on iOS, games downloaded via the App Store that have this feature enabled are able to integrate their achievement points, high-scores and bonus system across all iOS devices into a single accumulative points and social platform.
  

    [32]
   

  Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or cellular using a
  
   VoIP
  
  application.
  

    [33]
   


  The iPad 2 also adds the capability to support
  
   GarageBand
  
  ,
  
   iMovie
  
  , and the iWork apps
  
   Pages
  
  ,
  
   Keynote
  
  , and
  
   Numbers
  
  .
  

    [34]
   

  These applications do not come with the iPad but are instead official applications from Apple sold within the App Store. On March 7, 2012, after the unveiling of the third generation iPad, the firmware of the iPad 2 was upgradable to iOS 5.1.
  

    [35]
   

  Scott Rohde, a senior Sony executive described the iPad as "a
  
   game console
  
  disguised as a
  
   device
  
  that can be appropriated in the business workplace."
  

    [36]
   


  On September 19, 2012, almost a week after the announcement of the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  , iOS 6 was released for numerous iOS devices, including the iPad 2.
  

    [37]
   

  However, on iOS 6, not all features are available on the iPad 2. The software upgrade was downloadable as an over the air (OTA) update package and contains two-hundred new features, including a mapping software designed by Apple dubbed
  
   Apple Maps
  
  , a "Clock" app, which features a timer, stopwatch and alarm, and
  
   Facebook
  
  integration among other new features and tweaks.
  

    [37]
   


  The iPad 2 is compatible with
  
   iOS 7
  
  , which was released on September 18, 2013.
  

    [38]
   

  However, some features are not supported. For example, like the iPhone 4, the Notification Center and the Control Center use the transparent style instead of the translucent style in later iOS models.
 
  The iPad 2 supports
  
   iOS 8
  
  which was released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
  

    [39]
   

  While the device is still supported, most of the new features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.
 
  It was confirmed on June 8, 2015, at Apple's
  
   WWDC
  
  that the iPad 2 would support
  
   iOS 9
  
  . This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive
  
   Siri
  
  , translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and
  
   picture-in-picture
  

   multitasking
  
  , Low Power Mode and the Health app.
  

    [40]
   



    [41]
   

  iOS 9 is said to feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest that it did not significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and
  
   iPod Touch 5G
  
  (four major iOS versions).
 
  On June 13, 2016, following the release of
  
   iOS 10
  
  , Apple dropped support on the iPad 2 due to hardware limitations. The same goes with the
  
   iPad (3rd generation)
  
  and
  
   iPad Mini (1st generation)
  
  , making iOS 9 the final version supported on the device.
  

    [42]
   


  The iPad 2 features an
  
   Apple A5
  
  package-on-package (PoP)
  
   System-on-chip
  
  (SoC), which comprises a 1 GHz
  
   dual-core
  
  32-bit Cortex-A9
  
   CPU
  
  , 512 MB of
  
   RAM
  
  and a dual-core
  
   PowerVR SGX543MP2
  

   GPU
  
  .
  

    [2]
   



    [43]
   

  Other features include front and rear cameras, a three-axis
  
   gyroscope
  
  , headset controls,
  
   proximity
  
  and ambient light sensors,
  
   microphone
  
  ,
  
   magnetometer
  
  ,
  
   accelerometer
  
  and a 9.7 inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024×768 hence resulting in 132
  
   ppi
  
  .
  

    [2]
   

  The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute. The home button on the iPad 2 is "easier to double tap" than the previous generation of the iPad.
  

    [44]
   

  Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay, and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery.
  

    [45]
   

  The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's.
  

    [46]
   

  The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter
  

    [47]
   

  and through AirPlay as of iOS 5.
 
  The iPad 2 has a 25
  
   W·h
  

   rechargeable
  

   lithium-ion polymer battery
  


    [2]
   

  that lasts 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2
  
   A
  
  power adapter. The battery is 2.5 mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted.
  

    [45]
   

  The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x the power of a conventional USB port.
  

    [2]
   

  The tablet has an audio
  
   frequency response
  
  of 20
  
   Hz
  
  to 20 kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+),
  
   ALAC
  
  , AIFF, and WAV.
  

    [2]
   


  The revised tablet adds front- and rear-facing cameras, which allow
  
   FaceTime
  
  video calls with other iPad 2s, the third generation iPad,
  
   iPhone 4
  
  and
  
   4S
  
  , fourth-generation
  
   iPod Touch
  
  and
  
   Macintosh
  
  computers (running
  
   Mac OS X
  
  10.6.6 or later with a webcam).
  

    [48]
   

  The 0.3
  
   MP
  
  front camera shoots
  
   VGA
  
  -quality 30
  
   frame/s
  
  video and VGA-quality still photos.
  

    [2]
   

  The 0.7 MP back camera can shoot
  
   720p
  
  HD video at 30 frame/s and has a 5× times
  
   digital zoom
  
  .
  

    [5]
   

  Both shoot photo in a
  
   4:3
  
  fullscreen aspect ratio. The rear camera shoots video in 16:9 widescreen to match the 720p standard, although only the central 4:3 part of the recording is shown on the screen during recording.
  

    [12]
   

  The forward-facing camera shoots in 4:3.
  

    [49]
   


  The Apple A5 chip doubles processing speed and has graphics processing that is up to nine times faster than the previous iPad.
  

    [50]
   



    [51]
   

  However, benchtests and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that those claims are exaggerated; the benchmark assessment conducted by
  
   Anandtech
  
  showed that the GPU of the iPad 2 is only 3 times faster than that of the original iPad.
  

    [52]
   

  CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad.
  

    [53]
   



    [54]
   




  3G versions of the iPad 2 offer
  
   CDMA2000
  
  support for customers using the device on a CDMA network or
  
   GSM
  
  /
  
   UMTS
  
  support for customers using the device on a GSM/UMTS network. The iPad Wi-Fi + 3G model includes an
  
   A-GPS
  
  receiver for tracking the user's location given permission. Also, the iPad 2 3G model includes a plastic cap-like band at the top on the back for the 3G antenna. The metallic grille for the microphone is replaced with a matching plastic black grille on the 3G model.
  

    [55]
   

  GSM models of iPad 2 use a
  
   SIM
  
  card while CDMA models use an
  
   ESN
  
  to connect to the cellular network.
 
  The device is 15% lighter and 33% thinner than the original iPad; it is thinner than the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  by 0.5 mm.
  

    [56]
   

  The
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  version is 1.33 lb (600 g). Both the
  
   GSM
  
  and
  
   CDMA
  
  versions (known respectively as the
  
   AT&T
  
  and
  
   Verizon
  
  versions in the US) differ in weight slightly due to the mass difference between the GSM and CDMA cellular radios, with the GSM model at 1.35 lb (612 g) and the CDMA model at 1.34 lb (608 g). The size of the iPad 2 is also less than the original
  
   iPad
  
  at only 9.50×7.31×0.34 in (241.2×185.7×8.8 mm),
  

    [2]
   

  compared to the original iPad's size at 9.56×7.47×0.5 in (242.8×189.7×13.4 mm).
  

    [57]
   


  After the announcement and release of the third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5
  
   SoC
  
  , which is able to reduce battery consumption.
  

    [58]
   

  Benchmark tests conducted by
  
   Anandtech
  
  concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least an hour and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device.
  

    [58]
   

  The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance difference between the two variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.
  

    [58]
   


  The
  
   Smart Cover
  
  , first introduced with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.
  

    [59]
   

  While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a
  
   microfiber
  
  bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.
  

    [60]
   



    [61]
   


  Apple offers several more accessories for the iPad 2,
  

    [62]
   

  most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin
  
   dock connector
  
  , the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.
  

    [63]
   

  A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with
  
   Macs
  
  and
  
   PCs
  
  .
  

    [64]
   

  The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.
  

    [63]
   


  The iPad 2 received mixed to positive reviews, praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera.
  
   Joshua Topolsky
  
  of
  
   Engadget
  
  said that "for those of you who haven't yet made the leap, feel free to take a deep breath and dive in -- the iPad 2 is as good as it gets right now. And it's really quite good."
  

    [12]
   


   Jason Snell
  
  of
  

    Macworld
   

  said the following:
 
   "Though the iPad 2 is an improvement on the original iPad in numerous ways, it’s still an evolutionary product, not a revolutionary one. If you’re happy with your current iPad, there’s no reason to dump it just because there’s a shinier, newer one. (This is not to say that millions of people won’t do just that. I mean: shiny!) If you’ve invested in iPad accessories such as a dock or case, keep in mind that you probably won’t be able to use them with the new iPad."
   

     [65]
    



   TechCrunch
  
  's MG Siegler stated: "Let me sum all of this up in a simple way: the iPad 2, should you buy one? Maybe — it depends on a few factors. Will you want to buy one? Yes. Use that information wisely."
  

    [66]
   


  The closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism, particularly by
  
   digital rights
  
  advocates such as the
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  , computer engineer and activist
  
   Brewster Kahle
  
  , Internet-law specialist
  
   Jonathan Zittrain
  
  , and the
  
   Free Software Foundation
  
  who protested the iPad's introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their "
  
   Defective by Design
  
  " campaign.
  

    [67]
   



    [68]
   



    [69]
   



    [70]
   

  Competitor
  
   Microsoft
  
  , via a PR spokesman, has also criticized Apple's control over its platform.
  

    [71]
   


  At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS, namely
  
   DRM
  
  intended to lock purchased media to Apple's platform, the development model (requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS), the centralized approval process for apps, as well as Apple's general control and lockdown of the platform itself. Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will. Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple's approach to computing, particularly Apple's shift away from machines that hobbyists can "tinker with" and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation.
  

    [13]
   



    [72]
   


  Some iPad 2 users reported performance issues when running
  
   iOS 8
  
  . Apple improved performance on the iPad 2 and the
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  on the iOS 8.1.1 update. However, those 2 devices still don't run as fast as the later models.
 
  During the first weekend of sale, more than one million units were sold.
  

    [73]
   

  Soon after the first weekend, Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011.
  

    [74]
   

  Investment banking firm,
  
   Piper Jaffray
  
  monitored the initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only 26% of buyers owned a PC.
  

    [75]
   

  12,000 units were sold on auction site
  
   eBay
  
  in its first two weeks of release.
  

    [76]
   

  When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales.
  

    [77]
   

  Official figures released in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010.
  

    [15]
   


  In 2011 two iPad 2 tablets were taken to the
  
   International Space Station
  
  after being approved.
  

    [78]
   

  Other Apple products that were taken to ISS include the
  
   iPod
  
  and also two
  
   iPhone 4
  
  phones.
  

    [79]
   

  The other personal computing system aboard ISS were various versions of the
  
   ThinkPad
  
  laptop (IBM, later Lenovo brand).
  

    [80]
   


  Some of the applications the iPads were used for include Angry Birds game and the ISS FIT (International Space Station Food Intake Tracker) for tracking astronauts food consumption.
