  ) (
  
   IPA
  
  :/ɛl kæpitɑːn/) (version 10.11) is the twelfth
  
   major release
  
  of
  
   OS X (now named macOS)
  
  ,
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  's desktop and
  
   server
  
  operating system for
  
   Macintosh
  
  computers. It is the successor to
  
   OS X Yosemite
  
  and focuses mainly on performance, stability and security.
  

    [2]
   

  Following the
  
   California
  
  landmark-based naming scheme introduced with
  
   OS X Mavericks
  
  , El Capitan was named after a
  
   rock formation
  
  in
  
   Yosemite National Park
  
  , signifying its goal to be a refined version of Yosemite. El Capitan is the final version to be released under the name OS X; its successor, Sierra, was announced as
  
   macOS Sierra
  
  .
 
  The first beta of OS X El Capitan was released to developers shortly following the 2015
  
   WWDC
  
  keynote on June 8, 2015.
  

    [3]
   

  The first public beta was made available on July 9, 2015.
  

    [4]
   

  There were multiple betas released after the keynote. OS X El Capitan was released to end users on September 30, 2015, as a free upgrade through the
  
   Mac App Store
  
  .
  

    [5]
   




  All Macintosh computers that can run
  
   Mountain Lion
  
  ,
  
   Mavericks
  
  , or
  
   Yosemite
  
  can run El Capitan,
  

    [6]
   

  although not all of its features will work on older computers.
  

    [7]
   

  For example, Apple notes that the newly available
  
   Metal API
  
  is available on "all Macs since 2012".
  

    [8]
   


  These computers can run El Capitan, provided they have at least 2GB of RAM:
  

    [9]
   


  Of these computers, the following models were equipped with 1GB RAM as the standard option on the base model when they were shipped originally. They can only run OS X El Capitan if they have at least 2GB of RAM.
 
  The following computers support features such as
  
   Handoff
  
  ,
  
   Instant Hotspot
  
  ,
  
   AirDrop
  
  between Mac computers and iOS devices, as well as the new
  
   Metal API
  
  :
  

    [11]
   


  The upgrade varies in size depending upon which Apple Mac computer it is being installed on, in most scenarios it will require about 6 GB of disk space.
  

    [12]
   


  OS X El Capitan includes features to improve the security, performance, design and usability of OS X. Compared to OS X Yosemite, Apple says that opening
  
   PDFs
  
  is four times faster, app switching and viewing messages in
  
   Mail
  
  is twice as fast and launching apps is 40% faster.
  

    [13]
   



    [14]
   

  The maximum amount of memory that could be allocated to the graphics processor has been increased from 1024 MB to 1536 MB on Macs with an
  
   Intel HD 4000
  

   GPU
  
  .
  

    [15]
   

  OS X El Capitan supports
  
   Metal
  
  , Apple's graphics API introduced in
  
   iOS 8
  
  to speed up performance in games and professional applications.
  

    [16]
   

  Apple's typeface
  
   San Francisco
  
  replaces
  
   Helvetica Neue
  
  as the system
  
   typeface
  
  .
  

    [17]
   

  OS X El Capitan also adopts
  
   LibreSSL
  
  in replacement of
  
   OpenSSL
  
  used in previous versions.
  

    [18]
   


  OS X El Capitan introduces support for snapping two windows side by side to create a split view pressing the green button on left upper corner of the window, similar to the snap-assist feature in
  
   Windows 7
  
  (and later) and several
  
   Linux
  

   desktop environments
  
  , such as
  
   GNOME
  
  .
  

    [19]
   

  OS X El Capitan improves
  
   Mission Control
  
  to incorporate this feature across multiple spaces. It also enables users to spot the pointer more easily by enlarging it by shaking the mouse or swiping a finger back and forth on the
  
   trackpad
  
  .
  

    [20]
   


  OS X El Capitan adds
  
   multi-touch
  
  gestures to applications like Mail and
  
   Messages
  
  that allow a user to delete or mark emails or conversations by swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a trackpad. OS X also analyzes the contents of individual emails in Mail and uses the gathered information in other applications, such as
  
   Calendar
  
  . For example, an invitation in Mail can automatically be added as a Calendar event.
 

   Apple Maps
  
  in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to Maps in
  
   iOS 9
  
  .
  

    [13]
   

  This feature was limited to a handful of cities upon launch:
  
   Baltimore
  
  ,
  
   Berlin
  
  ,
  
   Chicago
  
  ,
  
   London
  
  ,
  
   Los Angeles
  
  ,
  
   Mexico City
  
  ,
  
   New York City
  
  ,
  
   Paris
  
  ,
  
   Philadelphia
  
  ,
  
   San Francisco
  
  ,
  
   Shanghai
  
  ,
  
   Toronto
  
  and
  
   Washington D.C.
  

  The
  
   Notes
  
  application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS 9. Both applications have more powerful
  
   text-processing
  
  capabilities, such as
  
   to-do lists
  
  (like in the
  
   Reminders
  
  application), inline webpage previews, photos and videos, digital sketches, map locations and other documents and media types. Notes replaces traditional
  
   IMAP
  
  -based
  
   syncing
  
  with
  
   iCloud
  
  , which offers better
  
   end-to-end encryption
  
  and faster syncing.
  

    [21]
   



   Safari
  
  in El Capitan lets users pin tabs for frequently accessed websites to the tab bar, similar to
  
   Firefox
  
  and
  
   Google Chrome
  
  . Users are able to quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without having to search for individual tabs. Safari supports
  
   AirPlay
  
  video streaming to an
  
   Apple TV
  
  without the need to broadcast the entire webpage.
  
   Safari extensions
  
  are now hosted and signed by Apple as part of the updated Apple Developer program and they received native support for
  
   content blocking
  
  , allowing developers to block website components (such as advertisements) without
  
   JavaScript
  
  injection.
  

    [22]
   



   Spotlight
  
  is improved with more contextual information such as the weather, stocks, news and sports scores. It is also able to process queries in natural language. For example, users can type "Show me pictures that I took in Yosemite National Park in July 2014" and Spotlight will use that request to bring up the corresponding info.
  

    [23]
   

  The app could now be resized and moved across the screen.
  

    [24]
   



   Photos
  
  introduced editing extensions which allows Photos to use editing tools from other apps.
  

    [25]
   


  OS X El Capitan has a new security feature called
  
   System Integrity Protection
  
  (SIP,
  

    [26]
   

  sometimes referred to as "rootless"
  

    [27]
   



    [28]
   

  ) that protects certain system
  
   processes
  
  ,
  
   files
  
  and
  
   folders
  
  from being modified or tampered with by other processes even when executed by the
  
   root user
  
  or by a user with root privileges (
  
   sudo
  
  ). Apple says that the root user can be a significant
  
   risk factor
  
  to the system's security, especially on systems with a single user account on which that user is also the administrator. System Integrity Protection is enabled by default, but can be disabled.
  

    [29]

  Upon release, OS X El Capitan was met with mostly positive reviews from both users and critics, with praise mostly going towards the overall functionality of the new features and improved stability. Dieter Bohn of
  

    The Verge
   

  awarded the operating system a score of 8.5 out of 10;
  

    [31]
   

  while
  
   Jason Snell
  
  of
  

    Macworld
   

  was also positive, rating it 4.5 out of 5.
  

    [32]
   


  After the 10.11.4 update, many users started reporting that their MacBooks were freezing, requiring a
  
   hard reboot
  
  .
  

    [33]
   

  This issue mostly affects Early 2015
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  computers, although many others have reported freezes in other models.
  

    [34]
   

  Several users created videos in
  
   YouTube
  
  which showed the freezes.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   



    [37]
   

  Soon after this, Apple released the 10.11.5 update, which contained stability improvements. Apple later acknowledged these problems, recommending their users to update to the last point release.
  

    [38]
   


  After the December 13, 2016 release of Security Update 2016-003, users reported problems with the WindowServer process becoming unresponsive, causing the GUI to freeze and sometimes necessitating a hard reboot to fix.
  

    [39]
   

  In response, on January 17, 2017, Apple released
  
   Security Update 2016-003 Supplemental (10.11.6)
  
  to fix "a kernel issue that may cause your Mac to occasionally become unresponsive" and at the same time released an updated version of Security Update 2016-003 which includes the fix released in the supplemental.
  

    [40]
   

  Users who have not previously installed Security Update 2016-003 are advised to install the updated version to reach build 15G1217, while users who have already installed the December 13, 2016 Security Update 2016-003 only need to install the supplemental update.
