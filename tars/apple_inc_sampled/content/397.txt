   Apple Computer 1
  
  , also known later as the
  
   Apple I
  
  , or
  
   Apple-1
  
  , is a
  
   desktop computer
  
  released by the Apple Computer Company (now
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  ) in 1976. It was designed and
  
   hand-built
  
  by
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  .

  Wozniak's friend
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was
  
   Apple
  
  's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a
  
   VW Microbus
  
  ,
  

    [3]
   

  for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his
  
   HP-65
  
  calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary.
  

    [4]
   

  It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the
  
   Homebrew Computer Club
  
  in
  
   Palo Alto, California
  
  .

  Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the
  
   Apple II
  
  , which
  

    Byte
   
   magazine
  
  referred to as part of the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing (along with the
  
   PET 2001
  
  and the
  
   TRS-80
  
  ).

  On March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the
  
   Homebrew Computer Club
  
  in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer.
  

    [7]
   

  After building it for himself and showing it at the Club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board—just the bare board, no electronic parts—that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture, their first company, Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell "something like 100" completely built computers to the
  
   The Byte Shop
  
  (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each. To fulfill the $50,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at
  
   30 days net
  
  and delivered the finished product in 10 days.

  The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of
  
   US$666.66
  
  ,
  

    [9]
   

  because Wozniak "liked repeating digits" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.
  

    [10]
   


  The first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to
  
   Liza Loop
  
  's public access computer center.
  

    [11]
   

  About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months.

  The Apple I's built-in
  
   computer terminal
  
  circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a
  
   keyboard
  
  and an inexpensive
  
   television set
  
  . Competing machines such as the
  
   Altair 8800
  
  generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red
  
   LEDs
  
  , most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a
  
   teletypewriter machine
  
  . This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475.
  

    [12]
   

  It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the
  
   Apple II
  
  in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.
  

    [13]
   

  In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple's price list.
  

    [14]
   

  As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers.
  

    [15]
   

  These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.
  

    [16]
   


  As of 2013, at least 63 Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist. Only six have been verified to be in working condition.
 
  Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as "01-00##" and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.

  Several Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years. These are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community. Availability is usually limited to small runs in response to demand.
