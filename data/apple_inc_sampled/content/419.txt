    [1]
   

  is an American entrepreneur who was an
  
   angel investor
  
  and second CEO of
  
   Apple Computer, Inc.
  
  , providing early critical funding and managerial support.
 
  Markkula was introduced to
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  and
  
   Steve Wozniak
  
  when they were looking for funding to manufacture the
  
   Apple II
  
  personal computer they had developed, after having sold some units of the first version of this computer, the
  
   Apple I
  
  . With his guidance and funding, Apple ceased to be a partnership and was incorporated as a company.

  Mike Markkula's great-grandfather Isak Ferdinand Markkula was born in
  
   Sievi
  
  , Finland. He and his wife moved to the United States in 1865
  

    [2]
   

  or 1883, depending on the source.
 
  Markkula's first name Armas and last name Markkula are traditional Finnish names. His first name Armas means "dear" or "beloved" in the Finnish language.

  Markkula received
  
   Bachelor of Science
  
  and
  
   Master of Science
  
  degrees in
  
   electrical engineering
  
  from the
  
   University of Southern California
  
  .
  

    [4]
   


  He made millions on
  
   stock options
  
  he acquired as a marketing manager for
  
   Fairchild Semiconductor
  
  and
  
   Intel
  
  , and retired at 32.
  

    [5]
   


  He was lured out of retirement by Steve Jobs, who was referred to him by
  
   Regis McKenna
  
  and venture capitalist
  
   Don Valentine
  
  .
  

    [5]
   

  Valentine—who after meeting the young, unkempt Jobs asked McKenna,
  
   "Why did you send me this renegade from the human race?"
  
  —was not interested in funding Apple, but mentioned Jobs' new company to Markkula.
  

    [6]
   

  Jobs visited him and convinced Markkula of the market for the Apple II and personal computers in general.
  

    [5]
   

  In 1977, Markkula brought his business expertise along with
  
   US$
  
  250,000 ($80,000 as an
  
   equity investment
  
  in the company and $170,000 as a loan) and became a one-third owner of Apple and employee number 3.
  

    [7]
   



   Steve Wozniak
  
  , who designed the first two Apple computers, credits Markkula for the success of Apple more than himself.
  

    [8]
   

  He helped the new company obtain
  
   credit
  
  and venture capital,
  

    [6]
   

  brought in
  
   Michael Scott
  
  as the first president and CEO, then took the job himself from 1981 to 1983 despite having promised his wife that he would only stay at Apple for four years,
  

    [5]
   

  and that he would retire by 1984.
  

    [6]
   

  Markkula served as chairman from 1985 until 1997, when a new board was formed after Jobs returned to the company. As chairman he approved
  
   Jef Raskin
  
  's 1979 plan to start designing what became the
  
   Macintosh
  
  , then prevented Jobs from killing the project in favor of his own
  
   Lisa
  
  .
  

    [9]
   

  In 1985 Markkula took
  
   John Sculley
  
  's side in a dispute with Jobs, causing the latter to leave the company, and in 1993 he helped to force Sculley out.
  

    [5]
   


  In addition to providing what
  

    The New York Times
   

  later described as "adult supervision" to the younger Jobs and Wozniak, as a trained engineer Markkula also possessed technical skills. He wrote several early Apple II programs, served as a
  
   beta tester
  
  for Apple hardware and software, and wrote one of the first three programs available for the unsuccessful
  
   Apple III
  
  . Wozniak was motivated to design the
  
   Disk II
  
  floppy disk drive system after Markkula found that a checkbook-balancing program he had written loaded too slowly from a
  
   data cassette
  
  .

  Markkula retired from Apple after Jobs returned as interim CEO in 1996, though he supported Jobs' return. Afterwards, he went on to work at
  
   Echelon Corporation
  
  , ACM Aviation, San Jose Jet Center and Rana Creek Habitat Restoration and to endow the
  
   Markkula Center for Applied Ethics
  
  at
  
   Santa Clara University
  
  , where he now chairs the Board.
