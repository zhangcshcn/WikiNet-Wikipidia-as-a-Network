    [1]
   

  is a family of
  
   general-purpose
  
  ,
  
   high-level programming languages
  
  whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964,
  
   John G. Kemeny
  
  and
  
   Thomas E. Kurtz
  
  designed the original BASIC language at
  
   Dartmouth College
  
  in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only
  
   scientists
  
  and
  
   mathematicians
  
  tended to learn.
 
  Versions of BASIC became widespread on
  
   microcomputers
  
  in the mid-1970s and 1980s.
  
   Microcomputers
  
  usually shipped with BASIC, often in the machine's
  
   firmware
  
  . Having an easy-to-learn language on these early
  
   personal computers
  
  allowed
  
   small business
  
  owners, professionals,
  
   hobbyists
  
  , and
  
   consultants
  
  to develop
  
   custom software
  
  on computers they could afford. In the 2010s, BASIC remains popular in many
  
   computing dialects
  
  and in new languages influenced by BASIC, such as
  
   Microsoft
  
  's
  
   Visual Basic
  
  .
 


  Before the mid-1960s, the only computers were huge
  
   mainframe computers
  
  . Users submitted jobs (calculations or other requests) on
  
   punched cards
  
  or similar media to
  
   specialist computer operators
  
  . The computer stored these, then used a
  
   batch processing
  
  system to run this queue of jobs one after another, allowing very high levels of utilization of these expensive machines. As the performance of computing hardware rose through the 1960s,
  
   multi-processing
  
  was developed. This allowed a mix of batch jobs to be run together, but the real revolution was the development of
  
   time-sharing
  
  .
  
   Time-sharing
  
  allowed multiple remote interactive users to share use of the computer, interacting with the computer from
  
   computer terminals
  
  with keyboards and
  
   teletype printers
  
  , and later
  
   display screens
  
  , in much the same way as desktop computers or
  
   personal computers
  
  would be used later.
 
  The original BASIC language was released on May 1, 1964 by
  
   John G. Kemeny
  
  and
  
   Thomas E. Kurtz
  


    [2]
   

  and implemented under their direction by a team of
  
   Dartmouth College
  
  students.
  

    [3]
   



    [4]
   

  The
  
   acronym
  

   BASIC
  
  comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz.
  

    [5]
   

  BASIC was designed to allow students to write mainframe computer programs for the
  
   Dartmouth Time-Sharing System
  
  . It was intended specifically for less technical users who did not have or want the mathematical background previously expected. Being able to use a computer to support teaching and research was quite novel at the time.
 
  The language was based on
  
   FORTRAN II
  
  , with some influences from
  
   ALGOL 60
  
  and with additions to make it suitable for timesharing. Initially, BASIC concentrated on supporting straightforward mathematical work, with
  
   matrix
  
  arithmetic support from its initial implementation as a batch language, and
  
   character string
  
  functionality being added by 1965. Wanting use of the language to become widespread, its designers made the compiler available free of charge. (In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with the very expensive computers, usually available only to lease.) They also made it available to high schools in the
  
   Hanover
  
  area, and put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as
  

    Dartmouth BASIC
   

  .
 
  Knowledge of the relatively simple BASIC became widespread for a computer language, and it was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer
  
   minicomputers
  
  such as the
  
   DEC
  

   PDP
  
  series, where
  
   BASIC-PLUS
  
  was an extended dialect for use on the
  
   RSTS/E
  
  time-sharing operating system. The BASIC language was available for the
  
   Data General Nova
  
  , and also central to the
  
   HP Time-Shared BASIC
  
  system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where the language was implemented as an
  
   interpreter
  
  . A version was a core part of the
  
   Pick operating system
  
  from 1973 onward, where a compiler renders it into
  
   bytecode
  
  , able to be interpreted by a virtual machine.
 
  During this period a number of simple
  
   computer games
  
  were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield's
  

    Star Trek
   

  . A number of these were collected by DEC employee
  
   David H. Ahl
  
  and published in a newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form,
  
   101 BASIC Computer Games
  
  , published in 1973.
  

    [6]
   



    [7]
   

  During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early
  
   personal computer
  
  . When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine,
  

    Creative Computing
   

  . The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.
  

    [8]
   


  The introduction of the first
  
   microcomputers
  
  in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite
  
   Dijkstra
  
  's famous judgement in 1975, "It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration",
  

    [9]
   

  BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers.
 
  One of the first BASICs to appear was
  
   Tiny BASIC
  
  , a simple BASIC variant designed by Dennis Allison at the urging of
  
   Bob Albrecht
  
  of the
  
   Homebrew Computer Club
  
  . He had seen BASIC on
  
   minicomputers
  
  and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines like the
  
   MITS Altair 8800
  
  . How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an
  
   interpreter
  
  for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the
  

    People's Computer Company
   

  newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in
  
   Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte
  
  . Versions were written by
  
   Li-Chen Wang
  
  and Tom Pittman.
  

    [10]
   

  In 1975 MITS released
  
   Altair BASIC
  
  , developed by
  
   Bill Gates
  
  and
  
   Paul Allen
  
  as the company Micro-Soft,
  

    [11]
   

  which eventually grew into corporate giant
  
   Microsoft
  
  . The first Altair version was co-written by Gates, Allen, and
  
   Monte Davidoff
  
  .
 
  Almost universally,
  
   home computers
  
  of the 1980s had a
  
   ROM
  
  -resident BASIC interpreter, which the machines
  
   booted
  
  directly into.
  

    [notes 1]
   

  When the
  
   Apple II
  
  ,
  
   PET 2001
  
  , and
  
   TRS-80
  
  were all released in 1977, all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in
  
   immediate mode
  
  was presented, not the
  
   command line interface
  
  used on systems running
  
   CP/M
  
  or
  
   MS-DOS
  
  .
  
   Commodore Business Machines
  
  included a version of Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The
  
   Atari 8-bit family
  
  had its own
  
   Atari BASIC
  
  that was modified in order to fit on an 8Â kB ROM cartridge. The
  
   BBC
  
  published
  
   BBC BASIC
  
  , developed by
  
   Acorn Computers Ltd
  
  , incorporating many extra
  
   structured programming
  
  keywords and advanced floating-point operation features.
 
  As the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to
  
   type in the code
  
  from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from
  
   Creative Computing
  
  as
  

    BASIC Computer Games
   

  . This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform.

    [13]
   



    [14]
   

  The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the
  
   home computer
  
  market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as
  
   Learn to Program BASIC
  
  would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused
  
   CP/M
  
  computers which soon became widespread in small business environments,
  
   Microsoft BASIC
  
  (
  
   MBASIC
  
  ) was one of the leading applications.
  

    [15]
   


  When IBM was designing the
  
   IBM PC
  
  they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft â
  
   IBM Cassette BASIC
  
  â but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for
  
   MS-DOS
  
  /
  
   PC DOS
  
  including
  
   IBM Disk BASIC
  
  (BASIC D),
  
   IBM BASICA
  
  (BASIC A),
  
   GW-BASIC
  
  (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and
  
   QBasic
  
  , all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo
  
   Pascal
  
  -publisher
  
   Borland
  
  published
  
   Turbo Basic
  
  1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name
  
   PowerBASIC
  
  ). Microsoft wrote the windowing-based
  
   AmigaBASIC
  
  that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. These languages introduced many extensions to the original home-computer BASIC, such as improved
  
   string manipulation
  
  and graphics support, access to the
  
   file system
  
  and additional
  
   data types
  
  . More important were the facilities for
  
   structured programming
  
  , including additional
  
   control structures
  
  and proper
  
   subroutines
  
  supporting
  
   local variables
  
  . However, by the latter half of the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others, rather than learning programming themselves, while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers.
  
   C
  
  and later
  
   C++
  
  became the languages of choice for professional
  
   "shrink wrap"
  
  application development.

    [17]
   


  BASIC's fortunes reversed once again with the introduction in 1991 of
  
   Visual Basic
  
  ("VB") by Microsoft. This was an evolutionary development of QuickBasic, and included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines, and optional static typing, as well as
  
   object-oriented
  
  constructs from other languages such as "With" and "For Each". But the language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, "Gosub"/Return statements, and optional line numbers which could still be used to locate the position of errors more precisely. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new
  
   macro language
  
  for
  
   Microsoft Excel
  
  , a
  
   spreadsheet
  
  program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of
  
   small businesses
  
  efficiently wherever ease of development was more of a concern than processing speed.
 
  By that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed "in the blink of an eye" even using a "slow" language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced
  
   VBScript
  
  in 1996 and
  
   Visual Basic .NET
  
  in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as
  
   C#
  
  and
  
   Java
  
  but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language.
 
  Many other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the
  
   open source
  

   QB64
  
  and
  
   FreeBASIC
  
  , inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled
  
   RapidQ
  
  ,
  
   Basic For Qt
  
  and
  
   Gambas
  
  . Modern commercial incarnations include
  
   PureBasic
  
  ,
  
   PowerBASIC
  
  ,
  
   Xojo
  
  ,
  
   Monkey X
  
  and
  
   True BASIC
  
  (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz). Several web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including
  
   Quite BASIC
  
  and Microsoft's
  
   Small Basic
  
  (educational software). Versions of BASIC have been showing up for use on
  
   smartphones
  
  and tablets. Apple
  
   App Store
  
  contains such implementations of BASIC programming language as
  
   smart BASIC
  
  ,
  
   Basic!
  
  ,
  
   HotPaw Basic
  
  ,
  
   BASIC-II
  
  ,
  
   techBASIC
  
  and others. Android devices feature such implementations of BASIC as
  
   RFO BASIC
  
  and
  
   Mintoris Basic
  
  . Applications for some mobile computers with proprietary OS (
  
   CipherLab
  
  ) can be built with programming environment based on BASIC. An application for the
  
   Nintendo 3DS
  
  and
  
   Nintendo DSi
  
  called
  

    Petit Computer
   

  allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support. A 3DS sequel was released in Japan in November 2014.
 
  Variants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise
  
   programmable calculators
  
  made by
  
   Texas Instruments
  
  , HP, Casio, and others.
  

    [18]
   



   QBasic
  
  , a version of Microsoft
  
   QuickBasic
  
  without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the
  
   Windows NT
  
  and DOS-
  
   Windows 95
  
  streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like
  
   Windows 7
  
  which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was
  
   GW-Basic
  
  . QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For
  
   Windows 95
  
  and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.
 
  The various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including
  
   LotusScript
  
  , which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic.
  

    [19]
   

  The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a
  
   Visual Basic for Applications
  
  (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like
  
   PerlScript
  
  , a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others;
  

    [20]
   

  meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells
  

    [21]
   

  SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as
  
   WordBasic
  
  . Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language.
  
   Chipmunk Basic
  
  , an old school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for
  
   GNU/Linux
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft Windows
  
  and
  
   macOS
  
  .
 
  The ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple "Try It In BASIC" exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Popular computer magazines of the day typically included
  
   type-in programs
  
  . Futurist and sci-fi writer
  
   David Brin
  
  mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006
  
   Salon
  
  article
  

    [22]
   

  as have others who first used computers during this era. In turn, the article prompted Microsoft to develop and release
  
   Small Basic
  
  .
  

    [23]
   

  Dartmouth held a 50th anniversary celebration for BASIC on 1 May 2014
  

    [24]
   

  as did other organisations; at least one organisation of VBA programmers organised a 35th anniversary observance in 1999.
  

    [25]
   


  Minimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and one- or two-letter variable names, which minimized requirements of limited and expensive memory (RAM). More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables "LOSS" and "LOAN", which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to "LOAN" would silently overwrite the value intended as "LOSS". Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; "SCORE" would be interpreted as "SC" OR "E", where OR was a keyword.
  
   String
  
  variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by "double quotation marks". Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.
 
  Some dialects of BASIC supported
  
   matrices and matrix operations
  
  , useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.
 
  The original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT.
  

    [notes 2]
   

  Although dropped by most later microprocessor derivatives it is used in this example from the 1968 manual
  

    [26]
   

  which averages the numbers that are input:
 
  New BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language's PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is
  
   Kernighan and Ritchie
  
  's
  
   Hello world program
  
  :
 
  An
  
   infinite loop
  
  could be used to fill the display with the message.
 
  Most first-generation BASIC versions such as
  
   MSX BASIC
  
  and
  
   GW-BASIC
  
  supported simple data types, loop cycles and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:
 
  The resulting dialog might resemble:
 
  Second-generation BASICs (for example,
  
   VAX Basic
  
  ,
  
   SuperBASIC
  
  ,
  
   True BASIC
  
  ,
  
   QuickBASIC
  
  ,
  
   BBC BASIC
  
  ,
  
   Pick BASIC
  
  and
  
   PowerBASIC
  
  ) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually,
  
   line numbering
  
  is omitted from the language and replaced with
  
   labels
  
  (for
  
   GOTO
  
  ) and
  
   procedures
  
  to encourage easier and more flexible design.
  

    [27]
   

  In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.
 
  The following example is in QuickBASIC:
 
  Third-generation BASIC dialects such as
  
   Visual Basic
  
  ,
  
   Xojo
  
  ,
  
   StarOffice Basic
  
  and
  
   BlitzMax
  
  introduced features to support object-oriented and
  
   event-driven programming
  
  paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as
  
   methods
  
  of standard objects rather than
  
   operators
  
  . Also, the
  
   Operating System
  
  became more and more available to the BASIC language.
 
  The following example is in
  
   Visual Basic .NET
  
  :
