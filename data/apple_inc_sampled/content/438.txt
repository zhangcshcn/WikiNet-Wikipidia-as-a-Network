  of
  

    Dancing with the Stars
   

  premiered on Monday, March 10, 2009, as part of
  
   ABC
  
  's spring line-up. The show generally followed the format of previous seasons, with 13 couples, although there were some changes, including two new dances (
  
   Argentine tango
  
  and
  
   Lindy Hop
  
  ), and an occasional dance-off between the bottom two couples, in order to determine who will be eliminated. The show was again hosted by
  
   Tom Bergeron
  
  and
  
   Samantha Harris
  
  .
  
   Len Goodman
  
  ,
  
   Bruno Tonioli
  
  and
  
   Carrie Ann Inaba
  
  all returned as judges again this season.
 
  Olympic gold-medal-winning gymnast
  
   Shawn Johnson
  
  won the competition at the age of 17, making her the youngest champion until
  
   Laurie Hernandez
  
  (another Olympian gymnast) won in
  
   season 23
  
  at 16. Shawn beat out
  
   Gilles Marini
  
  by less than 1%.
 


  The 13 celebrities and professional dancers who competed were:
 
  Originally, the season was advertised as the first U.S. season where a husband and wife would compete against each other: rodeo champion
  
   Ty Murray
  
  and singer-songwriter
  
   Jewel
  
  . The two had married the previous year after a ten-year
  
   courtship
  
  . However, just prior to the series, Jewel fractured both her
  
   tibias
  
  and was unable to perform. She was replaced on the show by
  
   Playboy
  
  model
  
   Holly Madison
  
  . Murray chose to continue on the show, and Jewel appeared during the season as a special musical guest.
 

   Nancy O'Dell
  
  , the then co-host of
  

    Access Hollywood
   

  , was also originally announced to be on the show, but was forced to withdraw from the competition due to a torn
  
   meniscus
  
  , which required surgery. She was replaced by
  
   Melissa Rycroft
  
  , a former
  
   Dallas Cowboys cheerleader
  
  who won season 13 of
  

    The Bachelor
   

  . She only had two days to practice her first dance.

   Week 2
  
  :
  
   Steve-O

  , the highest score of the night. Once the scores from weeks one and two were combined, Gilles & Cheryl held the top spot with 51, Mellissa & Tony, were placed in second, with 49 points, and Shawn & Mark, in third with 47. Steve Wozniak and
  
   Belinda Carlisle

Holly improved her score by one point, receiving 18, while Denise improved by four points, receiving a 20. However,

Shawn's combined score of 88 gave her the highest score of the night, tied with Gilles; the first time in eight weeks. Mark became the third, and only male, two-time champion. Shawn, Gilles, and Melissa are the only three couples to get perfect 30s this season, they were also the part of four dancers to maintain above a judges score of 7 (along with Lil' Kim) with Gilles receiving nothing below an 8 and Shawn receiving only one 7 (in week 1). Shawn and Gilles were the only couples not to be in the bottom two or at least not under the red light. Shawn is the fourth female winner, and additionally the sixth winner to get a perfect 30 on the freestyle.
