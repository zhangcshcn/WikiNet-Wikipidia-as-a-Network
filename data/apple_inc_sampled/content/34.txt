   industrial engineer
  
  and
  
   developer

  Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as
  
   senior vice president
  
  of worldwide operations and then served as
  
   Executive Vice President
  
  of worldwide sales and operations.
  

    [5]
   

  He was made Chief Executive on August 24, 2011.
  

    [6]
   

  During his tenure as the Chief Executive he has advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance,
  
   cybersecurity
  
  ,
  
   corporate taxation
  
  both nationally and abroad, American manufacturing, and
  
   environmental preservation
  
  .
 
  In 2014, Cook became the first Chief Executive of a
  
   Fortune 500
  
  company to publicly identify as gay.
  

    [7]
   

  Cook also serves on the boards of directors of
  
   Nike, Inc.
  


    [6]
   

  and the
  
   National Football Foundation
  
  .
  

    [8]
   

  In early 2012, he was awarded compensation of one million shares, vesting in 2016 and 2021, by Apple's board of directors, and in March 2015, he said he planned to donate his entire stock fortune to
  
   charity
  
  .
 


  Cook was born in
  
   Mobile, Alabama
  
  , United States,
  

    [9]
   

  He was baptized in a
  
   Baptist
  
  Church
  

    [10]
   

  and grew up in nearby
  
   Robertsdale
  
  . His father, Donald, was a
  
   shipyard
  
  worker, and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.
  

    [9]
   



    [11]
   


  Cook graduated from
  
   Robertsdale High School
  
  . He earned a
  
   Bachelor of Science
  
  (B.S.) in
  
   industrial engineering
  
  from
  
   Auburn University
  
  in 1982,
  

    [12]
   

  and his
  
   Master of Business Administration
  
  (MBA) from
  
   Duke University
  
  's
  
   Fuqua School of Business
  
  in 1988.
  

    [13]
   


  After graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years in
  
   IBM
  
  's personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment.
  

    [5]
   

  Later, he served as
  
   Chief Operating Officer
  
  of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics and was vice president for corporate materials at
  
   Compaq
  
  for six months.
  

    [14]
   


  In 1998, Steve Jobs asked Tim Cook to join Apple. In a
  
   commencement speech
  
  at
  
   Auburn University
  
  , Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs for the first time:
 
   "Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998 I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius, and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company."
   

     [15]
    


  His first position was
  
   Senior Vice President
  
  for worldwide operations.
  

    [5]
   

  In relation to the role, Cook was quoted as saying: "You kind of want to manage it like you're in the dairy business. If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem".
  

    [16]
   


  Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in
  
   flash memory
  
  from 2005 onwards, guaranteeing stable supply of what became a key
  
   iPod Nano
  
  , then
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPad
  
  component. Competitors at
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  , describing their cancelled
  
   TouchPad
  
  tablet computer, later said that it was made from "cast-off reject iPad parts."
  

    [17]
   

  Cook's actions were credited with keeping costs under control and, combined with the company's design and marketing savvy, generated huge profits.
  

    [18]
   


  In January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations
  

    [19]
   

  and served as Chief Executive in 2009, while Jobs was away on a leave of absence for health related issues. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.
  

    [20]
   



    [21]
   


  After Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new Chief Executive Officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011.
  

    [22]
   



    [23]
   

  Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from
  
   pancreatic cancer
  
  .
  

    [24]
   


   Forbes
  
  contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: "Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today".
  

    [21]
   

  In April 2012,
  

    Time
   

  included Cook on its annual "100 Most Influential People in the World" list.
  

    [25]
   


  On October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team.
  
   Scott Forstall
  
  resigned as senior vice president of
  
   iOS
  
  , and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013.
  
   John Browett
  
  , who was Senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, when he received 100,000 shares worth US$60 million.
  

    [26]
   

  Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP
  
   Sir Jonathan Ive
  
  assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team;
  
   Craig Federighi
  
  became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief
  
   Eddy Cue
  
  became responsible for Maps and Siri; and
  
   Bob Mansfield
  
  , previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.
  

    [27]
   


  Cook's executive changes occurred after the third quarter of the
  
   fiscal year
  
  (Q3), when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.
  

    [28]
   

  One commentator said that Forstall was forced to step down, as Cook "decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch". Since becoming CEO, Cook focused upon building a harmonious culture that meant "weeding out people with disagreeable personalities—people Jobs tolerated and even held close, like Forstall";
  

    [29]
   

  although, another journalist said that "Apple's ability to innovate came from tension and disagreement."
  

    [30]
   

  On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to "get out of the stock" if they didn't share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.
  

    [31]
   

  In May 2016, Cook traveled to
  
   China
  
  to meet with government officials there after the closure of Apple's online iTunes Store and iBooks store by the Chinese government.
  

    [32]
   


  Alongside
  
   Google
  
  vice-president
  
   Vint Cerf
  
  and
  
   AT&T
  
  CEO
  
   Randall Stephenson
  
  , Cook attended a closed-door summit held by
  
   President Barack Obama
  
  , on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the
  
   Internet
  
  in the wake of the
  
   Edward Snowden
  

   NSA incident
  
  .
  

    [33]
   



    [34]
   


  Following the
  
   December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino
  
  , California, in which 14 people were killed by
  
   Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik
  
  , the
  
   Federal Bureau of Investigation
  
  (FBI) solicited Apple to assist in "unlock[ing]" an iPhone 5C used by Farook.
  

    [35]
   

  On February 16, 2016, in response to a request by the
  
   Department of Justice
  
  , a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to create a custom iOS
  
   firmware
  
  version that would allow investigators to circumvent the phone's security features.
  

    [36]
   

  Cook responded in an open letter, wherein he denounced the government's demands as constituting a "breach of privacy" with "chilling" consequences.
  

    [35]
   



    [37]
   


  As Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30 a.m. and previously held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week.
  

    [16]
   

  Cook shared in May 2013 that his leadership strategy focused on people, strategy, and execution; he explained, "If you get those three right the world is a great place."
  

    [38]
   

  Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its donations to charity, and in 2013, he hired
  
   Lisa Jackson
  
  , formerly the head of the
  
   Environmental Protection Agency
  
  , to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.
  

    [39]
   



    [40]
   



    [41]
   


  Cook is a
  
   fitness
  
  enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. Cook is known for being mostly solitary. He uses an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and very little is known about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a "basic level of privacy".
  

    [16]
   



    [41]
   

  Cook was misdiagnosed with
  
   multiple sclerosis
  
  in 1996, an incident he said made him "see the world in a different way". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. Cook later told an Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from "lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around."
  

    [42]
   


  In 2009, Cook said that he offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type. Cook claims that Jobs responded by yelling, "I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that."
  

    [43]
   


  While delivering the 2010
  
   commencement speech
  
  at Auburn University, Cook emphasized the importance of
  
   intuition
  
  during significant decision-making processes in his life, and further explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.
  

    [44]
   


  In the 2008-2009 election cycle Cook donated to the
  
   Barack Obama
  
  's
  
   first White House election
  
  .
  

    [45]
   


  While it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook is gay,
  

    [46]
   



    [47]
   

  Cook chose to keep his personal life private.
  

    [48]
   

  He did publicly support
  
   LGBT rights
  
  .
  

    [49]
   

  In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.
  

    [50]
   

  The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens.
  

    [51]
   


  On October 30, 2014, Cook publicly identified as
  
   gay
  
  in an editorial for
  

    Bloomberg Business
   

  , stating "I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me."
  

    [52]
   

  Cook also explained that he has been open about his sexuality "for years" and, while many people at Apple were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended the article by saying "We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick."
  

    [53]
   

  As a result, Cook became the first openly gay CEO on the
  
   Fortune 500
  
  list.
  

    [54]
   

  In September 2015, Cook appeared on
  

    The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
   

  ; when asked about what inspired him to publicly reveal his sexual orientation, he responded, "Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do with other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth."
  

    [55]
   


  In 2015, Cook donated to
  
   Democratic
  
  senators
  
   Chuck Schumer
  
  and
  
   Patrick Leahy
  
  for their stances on eBook pricing and surveillance reform, respectively.
  

    [56]
   

  During the same election cycle he hosted a fundraiser for Senator
  
   Rob Portman
  
  .
  

    [56]
   


  In early March 2016, he donated to the election campaign of Democratic representative
  
   Zoe Lofgren
  
  from California, and in early June Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives
  
   Paul Ryan
  
  described by
  

    Politico
   

  as "a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House
  
   Republicans
  
  ."
  

    [56]
   


  According to
  

    Fortune
   

  , Cook has Apple stock worth about $120 million and
  
   options
  
  with a value of $665 million. In March 2015, he said he planned to donate his entire stock fortune to
  
   charity
  
  .
