   Alcatel-Lucent S.A.
  
  (
  
   French pronunciation: ​
  


    [alkatɛl lysɛnt]
   

  ) was a
  
   French
  
  global
  
   telecommunications equipment
  
  company, headquartered in
  
   Boulogne-Billancourt
  
  , France. As of January 2016, the company is part of
  
   Nokia
  
  .
  

    [1]
   


  The company focused on
  
   fixed
  
  ,
  
   mobile
  
  and
  
   converged
  

   networking hardware
  
  ,
  
   IP
  
  technologies,
  
   software
  
  and services, with operations in more than 130 countries. It had been named Industry Group Leader for Technology Hardware & Equipment sector in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices review
  

    [3]
   

  and listed in the 2014 Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators for the 4th consecutive year.
  

    [4]
   

  Alcatel-Lucent also owned
  
   Bell Laboratories
  
  , one of the largest research and development facilities in the communications industry, whose employees have been awarded eight Nobel Prizes and the company holds in excess of 29,000 patents.
 
  Alcatel-Lucent's
  
   chief executive officer
  
  was
  
   Michel Combes
  
  and the non-executive
  
   chairman
  
  of the board was
  
   Philippe Camus
  
  . Camus joined the company in the third quarter of 2008, alongside
  
   Ben Verwaayen
  
  as CEO, after Alcatel-Lucent's first CEO
  
   Patricia Russo
  
  and first chairman
  
   Serge Tchuruk
  
  resigned.
  

    [5]
   

  For 2010, the company had revenues of €16 billion and a reported net loss of €334 million.
  

    [6]
   

  For 2011, revenues were €15 billion, net loss of €1.1 billion. For 2012, revenues were €14.4 billion and net loss of €1.4 billion.
  

    [7]
   

  After seven consecutive years of negative cash flows, in October 2013 the company announced plans to slash 10,000 employees, or 14% of the total current 72,000 workforce, as a part of a €1 billion cost reduction effort.
  

    [8]
   


  In June 2013,
  
   Michel Combes
  
  announced "The Shift Plan",
  

    [9]
   

  a three-year plan including portfolio refocusing on IP networking, ultra-broadband access and cloud; 1 billion Euro in cost savings; selective asset sales intended to generate at least 1 billion Euro over the period of the plan and the restructuring of the Group's debt. On October 1, 2014, it announced that it had closed the sale of its subsidiary
  
   Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise
  
  to China Huaxin Post & Telecommunication Economy Development Center.
 


  Alcatel-Lucent was formed when Alcatel (originally short for the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Atomiques, de Télécommunications et d'Électronique, a small company in
  
   Mulhouse
  
  absorbed by CGE in 1966) merged with
  
   Lucent Technologies
  
  on December 1, 2006. However, the predecessors of the company have been a part of telecommunications industry since the late 19th century. The company has roots in two early telecommunications companies: La Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) and the
  
   Western Electric Manufacturing Company
  
  .
  

    [10]
   


  Western Electric began in 1869 when
  
   Elisha Gray
  
  and Enos N. Barton started a small manufacturing firm based in
  
   Cleveland, Ohio
  
  . By 1880, the company had relocated to Chicago, Illinois, and become the largest electrical manufacturing company in the United States. In 1881 the American Bell Telephone Company, founded by
  
   Alexander Graham Bell
  
  and forerunner of
  
   American Telephone & Telegraph
  
  (
  
   AT&T
  
  ), purchased a controlling interest in Western Electric and made it the exclusive developer and manufacturer of equipment for the
  
   Bell telephone companies
  
  .
  

    [10]
   


  CGE was formed in 1898 by French engineer Pierre Azaria in the
  
   Alsace
  
  region of what was then Germany and was a conglomerate involved in industries such as electricity, transportation, electronics and telecommunications. CGE would become a leader in digital communications and would also be known for producing the
  
   TGV
  
  (train à grande vitesse) high-speed trains in France.
  

    [10]
   



   Bell Telephone Laboratories
  
  was created in 1925 from the consolidation of the R&D organizations of Western Electric and AT&T. Bell Labs would make significant scientific advances including: the
  
   transistor
  
  , the
  
   laser
  
  , the
  
   solar cell battery
  
  , the digital signal processor chip, the
  
   Unix
  

   operating system
  
  and the
  
   cellular concept of mobile telephone service
  
  . Bell Labs researchers have won 7
  
   Nobel Prizes
  
  .
  

    [10]
   


  Also in 1925, Western Electric sold its International Western Electric Company subsidiary to
  
   ITT Corporation
  
  . CGE purchased the telecommunications part of ITT in the mid-1980s.
  

    [10]
   


  AT&T re-entered the European telecommunications market in 1984 following the
  
   Bell System divestiture
  
  . Philips promoted the venture in part because its
  
   PRX
  
  public switching technology was ageing and it sought a partner to help fund the development costs of digital switching. The joint company used the existing manufacturing and development facilities in
  
   The Hague
  
  ,
  
   Hilversum
  
  ,
  
   Brussels
  
  and
  
   Malmesbury
  
  as well as its U.S. resources to adapt the
  
   5ESS
  
  system to the European market. The joint venture company AT&T & Philips Telecommunications BV doubled annual turnover between 1984 and 1987, winning major switching and transmission contracts, mainly in the effectively captive Netherlands market. In 1987, AT&T increased its holding to 60% and in 1990 it purchased the remainder of the Philips' holding.
 
  In 1998, Alcatel Alsthom shifted its focus to the telecommunications industry, spinning off its Alsthom activities and changing the company's name to Alcatel. AT&T spun off Lucent Technologies in April 1996 with an initial public offering.
  

    [10]
   


  In April 2004,
  
   TCL Corporation
  
  and Alcatel announced the creation of a mobile phone manufacturing joint venture:
  
   Alcatel Mobile Phones
  
  .
 
  Facing intense competition in the telecommunications industry, Alcatel and Lucent Technologies merged on November 30, 2006.
  

    [11]
   


  On April 5, 2006, Alcatel announced that it would swap its shares of
  
   Alcatel Alenia Space
  
  and
  
   Telespazio
  
  for €673 million and a 12.1% stake in Thales, a key player in the French defense industry. This increased Alcatel's stake in
  
   Thales
  
  to 20.8%.
  

    [10]
   


  Alcatel-Lucent acquired
  
   Nortel
  
  's
  
   UMTS
  
  radio access business at the end of 2006. During 2007 the company acquired Canadian
  
   metro WDM networking
  
  supplier Tropic Networks, Inc.; enterprise services gateway products developer NetDevices;
  
   IPTV
  
  software company Tamblin; and the telecommunications consulting practice Thompson Advisory Group, Inc. Alcatel-Lucent acquired
  
   Motive, Inc.
  
  , a provider of service management software for broadband and mobile data services in 2008.
  

    [10]
   

  They formerly had a joint venture with Dutch company
  
   Draka Holding
  
  N.V. for manufacturing
  
   optical fibre
  
  , but Draka bought out Alcatel-Lucent's 49.9% stake for €209 million in December 2007.
  

    [12]
   


  In May 2009, Alcatel-Lucent's stake in Thales was acquired by
  
   Dassault Aviation
  
  .
  

    [13]
   

  Alcatel-Lucent announced the acquisition of
  
   OpenPlug
  
  on September 1, 2010.
  

    [14]
   


  In October 2011, Alcatel-Lucent sold its call-center services business
  
   Genesys
  
  unit to
  
   Permira
  
  , a private equity group, for $1.5 billion—the same amount the company bought the business for in 2000. Alcatel-Lucent needed funding for the Franco-American business, which made annual losses from 2007 to 2011.
  

    [15]
   


  In 2014 the Italian labs for the management system for terrestrial networks (1350 OMS) and two families of equipment for fiber optic telecommunications—OMSN (Optical Multi-Service Node) and TSS (Transport Service Switch)—were transferred to a new dedicated company, SM Optics, a subsidiary of the
  
   Siae Microelettronica
  
  group.
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   


  On April 15, 2015, Finnish telecommunications firm
  
   Nokia
  
  announced its intent to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms
  
   Ericsson
  
  and
  
   Huawei
  
  , whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. The acquisition was expected to be completed in early 2016, and was subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Regulatory approval was obtained in October 2015 and shareholder approval was announced on January 4, 2016. The Bell Labs division will be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand will be replaced by Nokia.
  

    [18]
   



    [19]
   



    [20]
   


  On January 14, 2016, Alcatel-Lucent started operating as part of the
  
   Nokia
  
  Group.
  

    [1]
   


  The company's global headquarters is in
  
   Boulogne-Billancourt
  
  ,
  
   France
  
  .
  

    [49]
   

  It has had previous head offices in the
  
   7th arrondissement
  
  of
  
   Paris
  
  ,
  
   France
  
  , and in the
  
   8th arrondissement
  
  of
  
   Paris
  
  ,
  
   France
  
  .
  

    [50]
   

  Its previous head office, in the
  
   8th arrondissement
  
  of Paris, was built between 1912 and 1929 and was renovated in 1998. During the renovation the building was decorated with a theme of the cosmos and time.
  

    [51]
   


  There are regional groups for the Americas, Asia Pacific & China, and Europe, Middle East & Africa.
  

    [52]
   

  Middle East and Africa Headquarters are at Smart Village, Giza,
  
   Egypt
  
  .
  

    [53]
   

  Alcatel was present in Italy with various research centers:
  
   Vimercate
  
  (in
  
   Lombardy
  
  ),
  
   Rieti
  
  ,
  
   Battipaglia
  
  ,
  
   Trieste

   Rome
  
  and
  
   Sesto Fiorentino
  
  . As of 2014, their presence is only in
  
   Vimercate
  
  (in
  
   Lombardy
  
  ),
  
   Trieste
  
  ,
  
   Rome
  
  .
 


    [54]
   




    [55]
   


  Core Networking segment includes three business divisions: IP Routing, IP Transport and IP Platforms. Access segment includes 4 business divisions: Wireless, Fixed Access, Licensing and Managed Services.
 

   Bell Labs
  
  was Alcatel-Lucent's
  
   research & development
  
  organization.
  

    [56]
   


  In 1876,
  
   Alexander Graham Bell
  
  was awarded the first patent for the
  
   telephone
  
  , and subsequently started
  
   AT&T
  
  .
  

    [57]
   


   Bell Labs
  
  is named in his honor.
 
  In 1937,
  
   Clinton Davisson
  
  shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter. His fundamental work is part of the foundation for much of today's solid-state electronics.
 
  In 1947, John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, William Shockley of Bell Labs invented the
  
   transistor
  
  . In 1956 they received a
  
   Nobel Prize
  
  for their invention. The transistor led to an electronics revolution during the post-war boom. The transition from
  
   vacuum tubes
  
  to transistors enabled all technologies to be built on a smaller scale and use less electricity. Items that before required large dedicated spaces, could now fit into a home or even on a kitchen counter.
  

    [58]
   


  In 1954,
  
   Gerald Pearson
  
  , Darryl Chapin and
  
   Calvin Fuller
  
  invented the
  
   solar cell
  
  .
  
   Telstar
  
  , the first active communications satellite also developed by Bell Labs and launched in 1962, used these solar cell batteries as an external renewable source of power once launched. It was the first to carry live television over water, between England and the US.
 
  In the late 1950s,
  
   Charles Townes
  
  and Arthur Shawlow of Bell Labs invented the
  
   laser
  
  , which has numerous applications, including measuring/cutting in the manufacturing industry and research/surgery in the medical industry. Bell Labs was awarded the laser patent in 1960.
 
  In 1964,
  
   Arno Allan Penzias
  
  and
  
   Robert Woodrow Wilson
  
  discovered the
  
   cosmic microwave background radiation
  
  . They were awarded the
  
   Nobel Prize
  
  in Physics in 1978.
 
  In 1969,
  
   Dennis Ritchie
  
  and a team of Bell Labs employees invented the
  
   UNIX
  
  operating system and the
  
   C programming language
  
  .
 
  In 2006,
  
   Willard S. Boyle
  
  and
  
   George E. Smith
  
  were awarded the
  
   National Academy of Engineering
  
  prize, for work on
  
   charge-coupled devices
  
  which transform patterns of light into useful digital information. In 2009 they received a Nobel Prize for their invention. The device is widely used in digital cameras, video cameras and modern astronomy.
 
  In 2013, there was a Net R&D investment of €2.3 billion (approx. 16% of sales). There are more than 32,000 active patents, more than 3,000 obtained in 2013, and 14,900 pending applications.
 
  The investigators were able to obtain greater capacity ever obtained in underwater data transmission with a single fiber. This experiment was based on the pioneering work of Bell Labs in data channels in a single carrier of 200 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). As speeds and distances to such noise and signal distortion make recovery of the data a real challenge, the researchers used innovative detection techniques and applied a new set of technologies modulation, transmission and processing together with an advanced error correction coding.
  

    [59]
   


  In December 2010, Alcatel-Lucent agreed to pay a total settlement of $137 million for bribing officials in
  
   Costa Rica
  
  ,
  
   Honduras
  
  ,
  
   Malaysia
  
  and
  
   Taiwan
  
  in violation of the U.S.
  
   Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
  
  (FCPA).
  

    [62]
   

  The
  
   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
  
  (SEC) alleged that Alcatel retained consultants to funnel bribes of over $8 million to government officials in order to obtain and retain lucrative telecommunications contracts.
  

    [63]
   



    [64]
   

  Alcatel admitted that it made profits of approximately $48 million as a result of the bribes and was ordered to pay $45 million to settle charges with the SEC and a further $92 million to settle the criminal charges brought by the
  
   U.S. Department of Justice
  
  (DOJ).
  

    [65]
   


  Lucent Technologies filed suit against
  
   Gateway
  
  and
  
   Dell
  
  , claiming they had violated patents on
  
   MP3
  
  ,
  
   MPEG
  
  and other technologies developed by
  
   Bell Labs
  
  , a division of predecessor company
  
   American Telephone & Telegraph
  
  . Microsoft voluntarily joined the lawsuit in April 2003, and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent. The case, involving a number of patents, is pending in U.S. District Court in San Diego, California.
  
   [
   


      when?
     


   ]
  

  The first part of the case involved two audio coding patents that Alcatel-Lucent claimed were infringed by Microsoft's Windows Media Player application. Alcatel-Lucent won the trial and $1.52 billion in damages, but the judge granted
  

    [66]
   

  Microsoft's motion for judgment and new trial.
  

    [67]
   



    [68]
   

  Alcatel-Lucent appealed.
  

    [69]
   


  In the second part of the case, the judge ruled that Microsoft had not violated Alcatel-Lucent's patents relating to speech recognition and the case was therefore dismissed before going to trial. Alcatel-Lucent intended to appeal.
  

    [70]
   



    [71]
   


  The third part of the case, involving several user interface-related patents, began on May 21, 2013.
 
  Additional patent infringement cases, some filed by Microsoft and some filed by Alcatel-Lucent, are pending in the United States.
 
  In May 2013,
  
   Newegg
  
  and
  
   Overstock
  
  won a victory in
  
   United States circuit court
  
  in which an Alcatel-Lucent
  
   shopping cart
  
  patent was invalidated.
