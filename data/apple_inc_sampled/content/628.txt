  in
  
   Chinese
  
  (
  
   traditional Chinese
  
  :
  
   華碩
  
  ;
  
   simplified Chinese
  
  :
  
   华硕
  
  , literally "Eminence of/by the Chinese [people]"). According to the company website, the name

  Asus was founded in
  
   Taipei
  
  in 1989
  

    [9]
   

  by
  
   T.H. Tung
  
  , Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,
  

    [10]
   

  all four having previously worked at
  
   Acer
  
  as
  
   hardware engineers
  
  . At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business.
  
   Intel Corporation
  
  would supply any new processors to more established companies like
  
   IBM
  
  first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering
  
   prototypes
  
  . According to the legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an
  
   Intel 486
  
  , but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with their motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.
