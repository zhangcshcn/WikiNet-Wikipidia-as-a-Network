  ) is a line of
  
   smartphones
  
  designed and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  They run Apple's
  
   iOS
  
  mobile operating system.
  

    [15]
   

  The
  
   first generation iPhone
  
  was released on June 29, 2007; the most recent iPhone model is the
  
   iPhone 7
  
  , which was unveiled at a special event on September 7, 2016.
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   


  The
  
   user interface
  
  is built around the device's
  
   multi-touch
  
  screen, including a
  
   virtual keyboard
  
  . The iPhone has
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  and can connect to cellular networks. An iPhone can
  
   shoot video
  
  (though this was not a standard feature until the
  
   iPhone 3GS
  
  ),
  
   take photos
  
  ,
  
   play music
  
  , send and receive email,
  
   browse the web
  
  , send and receive
  
   text messages
  
  , follow
  
   GPS navigation
  
  , record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive
  
   visual voicemail
  
  .
  

    [18]
   

  Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading
  
   mobile apps
  
  . As of January 2017, Apple's
  
   App Store
  
  contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone and other iOS devices.
  

    [19]
   


  Apple has released ten
  
   generations
  
  of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the
  
   iOS
  
  operating system. The original
  
   1st-generation iPhone
  
  was a
  
   GSM
  
  phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. The
  
   iPhone 3G
  
  added
  
   3G
  
  network support, and was followed by the
  
   3GS
  
  with improved hardware, the
  
   4
  
  with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the
  
   4S
  
  with improved hardware and the voice assistant
  
   Siri
  
  . The
  
   iPhone 5
  
  featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced
  
   Lightning connector
  
  . In 2013, Apple released the
  
   5S
  
  with improved hardware and a
  
   fingerprint reader
  
  , and the lower-cost
  
   5C
  
  , a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. They were followed by the larger
  
   iPhone 6
  
  , with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays. The
  
   iPhone 6S
  
  was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for
  
   pressure-sensitive touch inputs
  
  , as well as the
  
   SE
  
  —which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the
  
   iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
  
  , which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous phones.
  

    [20]
   


  The iPhone's commercial success has been credited with reshaping the smartphone industry and helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011.
  

    [21]
   

  The original iPhone was one of the first phones to use a design featuring a
  
   slate format
  
  with a touchscreen interface.
  

    [22]
   

  Almost all modern smartphones have replicated this style of design.

  In the US, the iPhone holds the largest
  
   share
  
  of the smartphone market. As of late 2015, the iPhone had a 43.6% market share, followed by
  
   Samsung
  
  (27.6%),
  
   LG
  
  (9.4%), and
  
   Motorola
  
  (4.8%).
  

    [23]
   




  Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple",
  

    [24]
   

  including
  
   Jonathan Ive
  
  , the designer behind the iMac and iPod.
  

    [25]
   

  Apple CEO
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form of the
  
   iPad
  
  ) and towards a phone.
  

    [26]
   

  Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (now
  
   AT&T Mobility
  
  ) at the time—at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months.
  

    [27]
   


  Apple rejected the "
  
   design by committee
  
  " approach that had yielded the
  
   Motorola ROKR E1
  
  , a largely unsuccessful collaboration with
  
   Motorola
  
  . Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100
  
   iTunes
  
  songs to avoid competing with Apple's
  
   iPod nano
  
  .
  

    [28]
   



    [29]
   


  Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house
  

    [30]
   



    [31]
   

  and even paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G),
  

    [32]
   

  in exchange for four years of exclusive US sales, until 2011.
 
  Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the
  
   Macworld
  
  2007 convention at the
  
   Moscone Center
  
  in San Francisco.
  

    [33]
   

  The two initial models, a 4 GB model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model at US$599 (both requiring a 2-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.
  

    [34]
   

  The passionate reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   

  Following this successful release in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK, France, and Germany in November 2007, and Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.
 
  On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six.
  

    [37]
   

  Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories.
  

    [38]
   

  Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the US, Canada and major European countries on June 19. Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost,
  

    [39]
   

  and 40% of users had household incomes over US$100,000.
  

    [40]
   


  The back of the original first generation iPhone was made of aluminum with a black plastic accent. The iPhone 3G and 3GS feature a full plastic back to increase the strength of the
  
   GSM
  
  signal.
  

    [41]
   

  The iPhone 3G was available in an 8 GB black model, or a black or white option for the 16 GB model. The iPhone 3GS was available in both colors, regardless of storage capacity.
 
  The iPhone 4 has an
  
   aluminosilicate
  
  glass front and back with a
  
   stainless steel
  
  edge that serves as the
  
   antennas
  
  . It was at first available in black; the white version was announced, but not released until April 2011, 10 months later.
 
  Users of the iPhone 4 reported dropped/disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way. This became known as
  
   antennagate
  
  .
  

    [42]
   


  On January 11, 2011,
  
   Verizon
  
  announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a
  
   CDMA
  

   iPhone 4
  
  . Verizon said it would be available for pre-order on February 3, with a release set for February 10.
  

    [43]
   



    [44]
   

  In February 2011, the Verizon iPhone accounted for 4.5% of all iPhone
  
   ad impressions
  
  in the US on Millennial Media's mobile ad network.
  

    [45]
   


  From 2007 to 2011, Apple spent $647 million on advertising for the iPhone in the US.
  

    [24]
   


  On Tuesday, September 27, Apple sent invitations for a press event to be held October 4, 2011, at 10:00 am at the
  
   Cupertino
  
  Headquarters to announce details of the next generation iPhone, which turned out to be
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  . Over 1 million 4S models were sold in the first 24 hours after its release in October 2011.
  

    [46]
   

  Due to large volumes of the iPhone being manufactured and its high selling price, Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue, in 2011, surpassing long-time leader
  
   Nokia
  
  .
  

    [47]
   

  American carrier
  
   C Spire Wireless
  
  announced that it would be carrying the iPhone 4S on October 19, 2011.
  

    [48]
   


  In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37 million iPhones, at an
  
   average selling price
  
  of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.
  

    [49]
   

  The production price of the iPhone 4S was estimated by
  
   IHS iSuppli
  
  , in October 2011, to be $188, $207 and $245, for the 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB models, respectively.
  

    [50]
   

  Labor costs are estimated at between $12.50 and $30 per unit, with workers on the iPhone assembly line making $1.78 an hour.
  

    [51]
   


  In February 2012,
  
   ComScore
  
  reported that 12.4% of US mobile subscribers used an iPhone.
  

    [52]
   

  Approximately 6.4 million iPhones are active in the US alone.
  

    [40]
   


  On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has a 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the
  
   SoC
  
  A6 processor, the chip is 22% smaller than the iPhone 4S' A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S, measuring 7.6 millimetres (0.3 in), and is 20% lighter at 112 grams (4 oz).
 
  On July 6, 2013, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Korean mobile carrier
  
   SK Telecom
  
  to release the next generation iPhone with LTE Advanced technology.
  

    [53]
   


  On July 22, 2013, the company's suppliers said that Apple is testing out larger screens for the iPhone and iPad. "Apple has asked for prototype smartphone screens larger than 4 inches and has also asked for screen designs for a new tablet device measuring slightly less than 13 inches diagonally, they said."
  

    [54]
   


  On September 10, 2013, Apple unveiled two new iPhone models during a highly anticipated press event in Cupertino. The iPhone 5C, a mid-range-priced version of the handset that is designed to increase accessibility due to its price is available in five colors (green, blue, yellow, pink, and white) and is made of plastic. The iPhone 5S comes in three colors (black, white, and gold) and the home button is replaced with a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID). Both phones shipped on September 20, 2013.
  

    [55]
   


  On September 9, 2014, Apple revealed the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus at an event in Cupertino. Both devices had a larger screen than their predecessor, at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively.
  

    [56]
   


  In January 2015, "Apple stands on second slot i.e only 31% in US market".
  

    [57]
   

  Competing devices with Android operating system have a market share approximately 62% of the US, 82.7% of the Chinese market, and 73.3% of the European market (countries such as the UK, France, Germany Spain and Italy).
 
  In 2016, Apple unveiled the
  
   iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
  
  , which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new dual-camera setup on the Plus model, new color options, and remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack.
  

    [20]
   


  Apple sold 6.1 million first generation iPhone units over five quarters.
  

    [58]
   

  Sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, temporarily surpassed those of
  
   Research In Motion
  
  's (RIM)
  
   BlackBerry
  
  sales of 5.2 million units, which briefly made Apple the third largest mobile phone manufacturer by revenue, after
  
   Nokia
  
  and
  
   Samsung
  


    [59]
   

  (However, some of this income is
  
   deferred
  


    [60]
   

  ). Recorded sales grew steadily thereafter, and by the end of
  
   fiscal year
  
  2010, a total of 73.5 million iPhones were sold.
  

    [61]
   


  By 2010, the iPhone had a market share of barely 4% of all cellphones, however Apple pulled in more than 50% of the total profit that global cellphone sales generate.
  

    [62]
   

  Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones in the third quarter of 2010, representing a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter, which was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. Apple's sales surpassed that of
  
   Research in Motion
  
  's 12.1 million
  
   BlackBerry
  
  units sold in their most recent quarter ended August 2010.
  

    [63]
   

  In the United States market alone for the third quarter of 2010, while there were 9.1 million Android-powered smartphones shipped for 43.6% of the market, Apple iOS was the number two phone operating system with 26.2% but the 5.5 million iPhones sold made it the most popular single device.
  

    [64]
   


  On March 2, 2011, at the
  
   iPad 2
  
  launch event, Apple announced that they had sold 100 million iPhones worldwide.
  

    [65]
   

  As a result of the success of the iPhone sales volume and high selling price, headlined by the
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  , Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue in 2011, surpassing long-time leader
  
   Nokia
  
  .
  

    [47]
   

  While the
  
   Samsung Galaxy S II
  
  proved more popular than the iPhone 4S in parts of Europe, the iPhone 4S was dominant in the United States.
  

    [66]
   


  In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37 million iPhones, at an
  
   average selling price
  
  of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.
  

    [49]
   


  For the eight largest phone manufacturers in Q1 2012, according to Horace Dediu at Asymco, Apple and Samsung combined to take 99% of industry profits (HTC took the remaining 1%, while RIM, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Nokia all suffered losses), with Apple earning 73 cents out of every dollar earned by the phone makers. As the industry profits grew from $5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 to $14.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012 (quadruple the profits in 2007),
  

    [67]
   



    [68]
   

  Apple had managed to increase its share of these profits. This is due to increasing carrier subsidies and the high selling prices of the iPhone, which had a negative effect on the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold an increasing number of iPhones.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   



    [71]
   

  By the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Apple's sales from the iPhone alone (at $22.7 billion) exceeded the total of
  
   Microsoft
  
  from all of its businesses ($17.4 billion).
  

    [72]
   


  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  and
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  were the best-selling handsets with sales of 27.4 million (13% of smartphones worldwide) and 17.4 million units, respectively, with the
  
   Samsung Galaxy S III
  
  in third with 15.4 million. According to Strategy Analytics' data, this was "an impressive performance, given the iPhone portfolio’s premium pricing," adding that the Galaxy S III’s global popularity "appears to have peaked" (the Galaxy S III was touted as an iPhone-killer by some in the press when it was released
  

    [73]
   



    [74]
   

  ). While Samsung has led in worldwide sales of smartphones, Apple's iPhone line has still managed to top Samsung's smartphone offerings in the United States,

  with 21.4% share and 37.8% in that market, respectively. iOS grew 3.5% to a 37.8%, while Android slid 1.3% to fall to a 52.3% share.
  

    [76]
   


  The continued top popularity of the iPhone despite growing Android competition was also attributed to Apple being able to deliver
  
   iOS
  
  updates over the air, while
  
   Android
  
  updates are frequently impeded by carrier testing requirements and hardware tailoring, forcing consumers to purchase a new Android smartphone to get the latest version of that OS.
  

    [77]
   

  However, by 2013, Apple's market share had fallen to 13.1%, due to the surging popularity of the Android offerings.
  

    [78]
   


  Apple announced on September 1, 2013, that its iPhone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the US. For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date. A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores.
  

    [79]
   


  On September 20, 2013, the sales date of the iPhone 5S and 5C models, the longest ever queue was observed at the New York City flagship Apple store, in addition to prominent queues in San Francisco, US and Canada; however, locations throughout the world were identified for the anticipation of corresponding consumers.
  

    [80]
   

  Apple also increased production of the gold-colored iPhone 5S by an additional one-third due to the particularly strong demand that emerged.
  

    [81]
   

  Apple had decided to introduce a gold model after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among
  
   Chinese
  
  customers.
  

    [82]
   


  Apple released its opening weekend sales results for the 5C and 5S models, showing an all-time high for the product's sales figures, with 9 million handsets sold—the previous record was set in 2012, when 5 million handsets were sold during the opening weekend of the 5 model. This was the first time that Apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of China in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result.
  

    [83]
   

  Apple also announced that, as of September 23, 2013, 200 million devices were running the iOS 7 update, making it the "fastest software upgrade in history."
  

    [84]
   


  An
  
   Apple Store
  
  located at the
  
   Christiana Mall
  
  in
  
   Newark, Delaware
  
  , US claimed the highest iPhones sales figures in November 2013. The store's high sales results are due to the absence of a
  
   sales tax
  
  in the state of
  
   Delaware
  
  .
  

    [85]
   


  The finalization of a deal between Apple and China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network, was announced in late December 2013. The multi-year agreement provides iPhone access to over 760 million China Mobile subscribers.
  

    [86]
   


  The iPhone Upgrade Program is a 24-month program designed for consumers to be able to get the latest iPhone every year, without paying the whole price up-front. The program consists of "low monthly payments", where consumers will gradually pay for the iPhone they have over a 24-month period, with an opportunity to switch (upgrade) to the new iPhone after 12 months of payment have passed. Once 12 months have passed, consumers can trade their current iPhone with a new one, and the payments are transferred from the old device to the new device, and the program "restarts" with a new 24-month period.
  

    [87]
   


  Additional features of the program include unlocked handsets, which means consumers are free to pick the network carrier they want, and 2-year AppleCare+ protection, which includes "hardware repairs, software support, and coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage".
  

    [87]
   


  Criticism of the program includes the potential endless cycle of payments, with
  

    The Huffington Post
   
   '
  
  s Damon Beres writing, "Complete the full 24-month payment cycle, and you’re stuck with an outdated phone. Upgrade every 12 months, and you’ll never stop owing Apple money for iPhones". Additionally, the program is limited to just the iPhone hardware; cell phone service from a network operator is not included.
  

    [88]
   


  Before the release of the iPhone, handset manufacturers such as
  
   Nokia
  
  and
  
   Motorola
  
  were enjoying record sales of
  
   cell phones
  
  based more on fashion and brand rather than technological innovation.
  

    [89]
   

  The smartphone market, dominated at the time by
  
   BlackBerry OS
  
  and
  
   Windows Mobile
  
  devices, was a "staid, corporate-led smartphone paradigm" focused on enterprise needs. Phones at the time were designed around carrier and business limits which were conservative with regards to bandwidth usage and battery life.
  

    [90]
   



    [91]
   

  Phones were sold in a very large number of models, often segmented by marketing strategy, confusing customers and sapping engineering resources.
  

    [92]
   



    [93]
   

  For example, phones marketed at business were often deliberately stripped of cameras or the ability to play music and games.
  

    [94]
   

  Apple's approach was to deliberately simplify its product line by offering just one model a year for all customers, while making it an expensive, high-end product.
 
  Apple's marketing, developing from the success of iPod campaigns, allowed the phone to become a mass-market product with many buyers on launch day. Some market research has found that, unusually for a technology product, iPhone users are disproportionately female.
  

    [95]
   



    Ars Technica
   

  noted in 2012 that Apple had avoided 'patronizing' marketing to female customers, a practice used (often to sell low-quality, high-priced products) by many of its competitors.
  

    [96]
   


  When then-CEO of
  
   Research in Motion
  

   Mike Lazaridis
  
  pried open an iPhone, his impression was of a Mac stuffed into a cellphone, as it used much more memory and processing power than the smartphones on the market at the time.
  

    [90]
   



    [91]
   

  With its
  
   capacitive touchscreen
  
  and consumer-friendly design, the iPhone fundamentally changed the mobile industry, with
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  proclaiming in 2007, that the phone was not just a communication tool but a way of life.
  

    [97]
   


  The dominant mobile operating systems at the time such as
  
   Symbian
  
  ,
  
   BlackBerry OS
  
  , and
  
   Windows Mobile
  
  were not designed to handle additional tasks beyond communication and basic functions. These operating systems never focused on applications and developers, and due to infighting among manufacturers as well as the complexity of developing on their low-memory hardware, they never developed a thriving ecosystem like Apple's
  
   App Store
  
  or
  
   Android
  
  's
  
   Google Play
  
  .
  

    [97]
   



    [98]
   


   IPhone OS
  
  (renamed iOS in 2010) was designed as a robust OS with capabilities such as multitasking and graphics in order to meet future consumer demands.
  

    [94]
   

  Many services were provided by mobile carries, who often extensively customized devices. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to base its OS on
  
   OS X
  
  had the unexpected benefit of allowing OS X developers to rapidly expand into iOS development.
  

    [99]
   

  Rival manufacturers have been forced to spend more on software and development costs to catch up to the iPhone. The iPhone's success has led to a decline in sales of high-end fashion phones and business-oriented smartphones such as
  
   Vertu
  
  and
  
   BlackBerry
  
  and respectively, as well as Nokia.
  

    [97]
   



    [100]
   

  Nokia realised the limitations of its operating system Symbian and attempted to develop a more advanced system, Maemo, without success. It ultimately agreed to a technology-sharing deal and then a takeover from Microsoft.
  

    [101]
   


  Up to the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  , all iPhone models, as well as other
  
   iOS devices
  
  were manufactured exclusively by
  
   Foxconn
  
  , based in
  
   Taiwan
  
  . In 2011, after
  
   Tim Cook
  
  became CEO of the company, Apple changed its outsourcing strategy, for the first time increasing its supply partners. The
  
   iPhone 4s
  
  in 2012, was the first model which was manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies; Foxconn as well as
  
   Pegatron
  
  , also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn is still responsible for the larger share of production, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased, with the company being tasked with producing a part of the
  
   iPhone 5C
  
  line in 2013, and 30% of the
  
   iPhone 6
  
  devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model is being produced solely by Foxconn.
  

    [102]
   


  The
  
   touchscreen
  
  on the first five generations is a 9 cm (3.5 in)
  
   liquid crystal display
  
  with scratch-resistant glass, while the one on the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  is 4 inches.
  

    [8]
   

  The
  
   capacitive touchscreen
  
  is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for
  
   multi-touch
  
  sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320×480 (
  
   HVGA
  
  ) at 163
  
   ppi
  
  ; those on the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  and
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  have a resolution of 640×960 at 326 ppi, and the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  , 640×1136 at 326 ppi. All iPhones were and still are equipped with LCDs. The initial models were using
  
   twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs
  
  . Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to
  
   in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs
  
  . The
  
   iPhone 5
  
  model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9.
 
  The touch and gesture features of the iPhone are based on technology originally developed by
  
   FingerWorks
  
  .
  

    [103]
   

  Most gloves and
  
   styli
  
  prevent the necessary electrical conductivity;
  

    [104]
   



    [105]
   



    [106]
   



    [107]
   

  although
  
   capacitive styli
  
  can be used with iPhone's finger-touch screen. The iPhone 3GS and later also feature a
  
   fingerprint
  
  -resistant
  
   oleophobic
  
  coating.
  

    [108]
   


  The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, featuring five
  
   buttons
  
  . The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the "Home button" because it closes the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. The home button is denoted not by a house, as on many other similar devices, but a
  
   rounded square
  
  , reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen. However, the Home button on iPhones with Apple's
  
   fingerprint recognition
  
  feature
  
   Touch ID
  
  (which use the Home button as the fingerprint sensor) have no symbol.
 
  A multi-function sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls
  
   phone calls
  
  . When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.
 
  Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.
  

    [109]
   

  All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original first generation iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the
  
   user interface
  
  .
 
  A software update in January 2008
  

    [110]
   

  allowed the first-generation iPhone to use cell tower and Wi-Fi network locations
  
   trilateration
  
  ,
  

    [111]
   

  despite lacking
  
   GPS
  
  hardware. Since the iPhone 3G generation, the iPhone employs
  
   A-GPS
  
  operated by the United States. Since the iPhone 4S generation the device also supports the
  
   GLONASS
  
  global positioning system, which is operated by Russia.
 
  The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, introduced in 2015, feature "force-touch" displays which allows the screen to recognize how hard it is being pressed. An example of how this technology will be used is lightly pressing the screen to preview a photograph and pressing down to take it.
 
  Latest iPhone devices feature eight sensors, which are used to adjust the screen based on operating conditions, enable motion-controlled games, and
  
   location-based services
  
  .
 
  A
  
   proximity sensor
  
  deactivates the display and
  
   touchscreen
  
  when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears.
 
  An
  
   ambient light sensor
  
  adjusts the display brightness which saves battery power and prevents the screen from being too bright or too dark.
 
  A 3-axis
  
   accelerometer
  
  senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between
  
   portrait and landscape
  
  mode.
  

    [112]
   

  Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations.
  

    [113]
   

  Unlike the
  
   iPad
  
  , the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home button above the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so. The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input.
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   

  The accelerometer can also be used to control
  
   third-party apps
  
  , notably games. It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a
  
   pedometer
  
  .
 
  A
  
   magnetometer
  
  is built-in since the iPhone 3GS generation, which is used to measure the strength and/or direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device. Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re-calibrate by moving the device in a figure 8 motion. Since the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone also features a Compass app which was unique at time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field.
 
  Beginning with the iPhone 4 generation, Apple's smartphones also include a
  
   gyroscopic sensor
  
  , enhancing its perception of how it is moved.
 
  The iPhone contains a chip capable of receiving
  
   radio signals
  
  ,
  

    [116]
   

  however Apple has the FM radio feature switched off, claiming a lack of demand due to the popularity of music-streaming apps,
  

    [117]
   

  however it has been noted that cellphone manufacturers make money from selling data.
  

    [118]
   

  A campaign called "Free Radio On My Phone" was started to encourage cellphone manufacturers such as Apple to enable the radio on the phones they manufacture, reasons cited were that radio drains less power and is useful in an emergency such as the
  
   2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire
  
  .
  

    [119]
   


  Most iPhone models starting from
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  (excluding the
  
   iPhone 5C
  
  ) all feature Apple's
  
   fingerprint recognition
  
  sensor known as
  
   Touch ID
  
  , and is located on the Home button of the iPhone.
 
  Included on the
  
   iPhone 6
  
  and later (excluding the
  
   iPhone SE
  
  ), a
  
   barometer
  
  used to determine air pressure, and elevation from the device.
  

    [120]
   


  On the bottom of the iPhone, there is a speaker to the left of the dock connector and a microphone to the right. There is an additional loudspeaker above the screen that serves as an earpiece during phone calls. The iPhone 4 includes an additional
  
   microphone
  
  at the top of the unit for
  
   noise cancellation
  
  , and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unit—the speaker is on the right.
  

    [121]
   

  Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.
 
  The 3.5mm
  
   TRRS connector
  
  for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device for the first five generations (original through 4S), after which time it was moved to the bottom left corner.
  

    [122]
   

  The headphone socket on the 1st-generation iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter.
  

    [123]
   

  Subsequent generations eliminated the problem by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an
  
   auxiliary jack
  
  allow handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for
  
   Bluetooth
  
  . The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have no 3.5mm headphone jack,
  

    [124]
   

  and instead headsets must connect to the iPhone by
  
   Bluetooth
  
  , use Apple's
  
   Lightning port
  
  (which has replaced the 3.5mm headphone jack), or (for traditional headsets) use the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, which is included with all iPhone and 7 Plus units, and plugs into the Lightning port.
 
  Apple's own
  
   headset
  
  has a multipurpose button near the microphone that can play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. Some third-party headsets designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button.
  

    [125]
   

  The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models.
  

    [126]
   

  A fourth ring in the audio jack carries this extra information.
 
  The built-in
  
   Bluetooth 2.x+EDR
  
  supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the
  
   HSP
  

   profile
  
  . Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports
  
   A2DP
  
  .
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   

  While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the
  
   OBEX
  

   file transfer
  

   protocol
  
  .
  

    [127]
   

  The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other Bluetooth-enabled cell phones.
 
  Composite
  

    [128]
   

  or component
  

    [129]
   

  video at up to
  
   576i
  
  and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple. IPhone 4 also supports 1024×768
  
   VGA
  
  output
  

    [130]
   

  without audio, and
  
   HDMI
  
  output,
  

    [131]
   

  with stereo audio, via dock adapters. The iPhone did not support
  
   voice recording
  
  until the 3.0 software update.
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   


  The iPhone features an internal rechargeable
  
   lithium-ion battery
  
  . Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones at the time of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable.
  

    [123]
   



    [132]
   

  The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to
  
   charging an iPod
  
  . Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or "wall charger," also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an
  
   AC outlet
  
  .
 
  Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life. Apple's website says that the battery life "is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles",
  

    [133]
   

  which is comparable to iPod batteries.
 
  The battery life of early models of the iPhone has been criticized by several technology journalists as insufficient and less than Apple's claims.
  

    [134]
   



    [135]
   



    [136]
   



    [137]
   

  This is also reflected by a
  
   J. D. Power and Associates
  
  customer satisfaction survey, which gave the "battery aspects" of the iPhone 3G its lowest rating of 2 out of 5 stars.
  

    [138]
   



    [139]
   


  If the battery malfunctions or dies prematurely, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still under
  
   warranty
  
  .
  

    [140]
   

  The warranty lasts one year from purchase and can be extended to two years with
  
   AppleCare
  
  . The battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched;
  

    [141]
   



    [142]
   

  it is similar to how Apple (and third parties) replace batteries for iPods. The
  
   Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
  
  , a
  
   consumer advocate
  
  group, has sent a complaint to Apple and
  
   AT&T
  
  over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced.
  

    [141]
   


  Since July 2007, third-party battery replacement kits have been available
  

    [143]
   

  at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program. These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the first generation iPhone has been
  
   soldered
  
  in. Therefore, a soldering iron is required to install the new battery. The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace.
  

    [144]
   


  A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.
  

    [145]
   


  The 1st-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G have a
  
   fixed-focus
  
  2.0-
  
   megapixel
  
  camera on the back for digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or
  
   autofocus
  
  , and does not natively support video recording. (iPhone (original) & 3G can record video via a third-party app available on the App Store, and
  
   jailbreaking
  
  also allows users to do so.) IPhone OS 2.0 introduced
  
   geotagging
  
  for photos.
 
  The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10 cm). Manufactured by
  
   OmniVision
  
  , the camera can also capture 640×480 (
  
   VGA
  
  resolution) video at 30 frames per second,
  

    [146]
   

  although unlike higher-end
  
   CCD
  
  -based video cameras, it exhibits the
  
   rolling shutter
  
  effect.
  

    [147]
   

  The video can be
  
   cropped
  
  on the iPhone and directly uploaded to YouTube or other services.
 
  The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0-
  
   megapixel
  
  camera (2592×1936 pixels) that can record video at
  
   720p
  
  resolution, considered
  
   high-definition
  
  . It also has a
  
   backside-illuminated
  
  sensor that can capture pictures in low light and an
  
   LED
  

   flash
  
  that can stay lit while recording video.
  

    [148]
   

  It is the first iPhone that can natively do
  
   high dynamic range photography
  
  .
  

    [149]
   

  The iPhone 4 also has a second camera on the front that can take
  
   VGA
  
  photos and record
  
   SD
  
  video. Saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by
  
   MMS
  
  .
 
  The iPhone 4S' camera can shoot 8-MP stills and 1080p video, can be accessed directly from the lock screen, and can be triggered using the volume-up button as a shutter trigger. The built-in gyroscope can stabilize the image while recording video.
 
  The
  
   iPhone 5
  
  and
  
   iPhone 4S
  
  , running
  
   iOS 6
  
  or later, can take panoramas using the built-in camera app,
  

    [150]
   

  and the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  can also take still photos while recording video.
  

    [151]
   


  The camera on the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  reportedly shows purple haze when the light source is just out of frame,
  

    [152]
   

  although Consumer Reports said it "is no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several Android phones with fine cameras..."
  

    [153]
   


  On all five model generations, the phone can be configured to bring up the camera app by quickly pressing the home key twice.
  

    [154]
   

  On all iPhones running
  
   iOS 5
  
  , it can also be accessed from the lock screen directly.
 
  The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are outfitted with 12 megapixel camera, with 4K HD video capability. Just as well, the user may change the resolution between 4K and 1080p from settings.
 
  The iPhone 7 features
  
   Optical Image Stabilization
  
  on its rear camera, and the 7 Plus is the first iPhone to feature dual-lens camera (both 12 MP), and they both have a 7 MP front-facing camera. The second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a
  
   telephoto lens
  
  , which enables 2x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom. The rear cameras on the 7 and 7 Plus are both f/1.8
  
   aperture
  
  .

  The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4 GB or 8 GB. On September 5, 2007, Apple discontinued the 4 GB models.
  

    [155]
   

  On February 5, 2008, Apple added a 16 GB model.
  

    [156]
   

  The iPhone 3G was available in 16 GB and 8 GB. The iPhone 3GS came in 16 GB and 32 GB variants and remained available in 8 GB until September 2012, more than three years after its launch. The iPhone 4 was available in 16 GB and 32 GB variants, as well as an 8 GB variant to be sold alongside the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point. The iPhone 4S was available in three sizes: 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB. The iPhone 5 and 5s were available in the same three sizes previously available to the iPhone 4S: 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB. The lower-cost iPhone 5C model was initially available in 16 GB and 32 GB models; an 8 GB model was added later. The iPhone 6 and 6S are available in three sizes: 16 GB, 64 GB, and 128 GB. The iPhone SE is available in 16 GB and 64 GB variants. By the time the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was released, Apple ditched the based model from 16 GB to 32 GB as the base storage. Both 7 & 7 Plus has a configuration of 32, 128, & 256 GB storage option. And Apple also doubled the storage on the iPhone 6s & 6s Plus in 2 configurations (32 GB & 128 GB).
 

   GSM
  
  models of the iPhone use a
  
   SIM card
  
  to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a
  
   paper clip
  
  or the "SIM ejector tool" (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS in the United States and with all models elsewhere in the world.
  

    [157]
   



    [158]
   

  Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed "
  
   Liquidmetal
  
  ".
  

    [159]
   

  In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a
  
   SIM lock
  
  , which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network.
  

    [160]
   


  The
  
   GSM
  
  iPhone 4 features a
  
   MicroSIM
  
  card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.
  

    [161]
   


  The
  
   CDMA
  
  model of the iPhone 4, just the same as any other CDMA-only cell phone, does not use a SIM card or have a SIM card slot.
 
  An iPhone 4S activated on a CDMA carrier, however, does have a SIM card slot but does not rely on a SIM card for activation on that CDMA network. A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only. The SIM slot is locked to only use the roaming SIM card provided by the CDMA carrier.
  

    [162]
   


  In the case of Verizon, for example, one can request that the SIM slot be unlocked for international use by calling their support number and requesting an international unlock if their account has been in good standing for the past 60 days.
  

    [163]
   

  This method only unlocks the iPhone 4S for use on international carriers. An iPhone 4S that has been unlocked in this way will reject any non international SIM cards (AT&T Mobility or T-Mobile USA, for example).
 
  The iPhone 5 and later iPhones use the
  
   nano-SIM
  
  , in order to save more space for internal components.
 
  All iPhones (as well as many other devices by Apple) have a small disc at the bottom of the headphone
  
   jack
  
  that changes from white to red on contact with water; the iPhone 3G and later models also have a similar indicator at the bottom of the
  
   dock connector
  
  .
  

    [164]
   

  Because Apple warranties do not cover water damage, employees examine the indicators before approving
  
   warranty repair or replacement
  
  .
 
  The iPhone's indicators are more exposed than those in some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover. The iPhone's can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat,
  

    [165]
   

  steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture.
  

    [166]
   

  Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.
  

    [167]
   


  All
  
   iPhone models
  
  include written documentation, and a
  
   dock connector
  
  to
  
   USB
  
  cable. The first generation and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The first generation iPhone included a stereo
  
   headset
  
  (
  
   earbuds
  
  and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone
  
   3G
  
  includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the first generation model requires a
  
   paperclip
  
  ). The iPhone
  
   3GS
  
  includes the
  
   SIM
  
  eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions).
  

    [126]
   



    [168]
   


  The iPhone 3G and 3GS are compatible with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock.
  

    [169]
   

  All versions include a USB power adapter, or "wall charger," which allows the iPhone to charge from an
  
   AC outlet
  
  . The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS sold in North America, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru
  

    [170]
   



    [171]
   

  include an ultracompact USB power adapter.
 
  The iPhone,
  
   iPod Touch
  
  and
  
   iPad
  
  run an
  
   operating system
  
  known as
  
   iOS
  
  (formerly iPhone OS). It is a variant of the same
  
   Darwin
  
  operating system core that is found in Mac
  
   OS X
  
  . Also included is the "
  
   Core Animation
  
  " software component from
  
   Mac OS X v10.5
  
  Leopard. Together with the
  
   PowerVR
  
  hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS,
  
   OpenGL ES
  
  2.0), it is responsible for the interface's
  
   motion graphics
  
  . The operating system takes up less than half a
  
   gigabyte
  
  .
  

    [172]
   


  It is capable of supporting bundled and future applications from Apple, as well as from third-party developers. Software applications cannot be copied directly from Mac OS X but must be written and compiled specifically for iOS.
 
  Like the iPod, the iPhone is managed from a computer using
  
   iTunes
  
  . The earliest versions of the OS required
  
   version 7.3 or later
  
  , which is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.3.9 Panther or later, and 32-bit
  
   Windows XP
  
  or
  
   Vista
  
  .
  

    [173]
   

  The release of iTunes 7.6 expanded this support to include 64-bit versions of XP and Vista,
  

    [174]
   

  and a workaround has been discovered for previous 64-bit Windows operating systems.
  

    [175]
   


  Apple provides free updates to the OS for the iPhone through iTunes,
  

    [172]
   

  and major updates have historically accompanied new models.
  

    [176]
   

  Such updates often require a newer version of iTunes—for example, the 3.0 update requires iTunes 8.2—but the iTunes system requirements have stayed the same. Updates include bug fixes, security patches and new features.
  

    [177]
   

  For example, iPhone 3G users initially experienced dropped calls until an update was issued.
  

    [178]
   



    [179]
   


  Version 3.1 required iTunes 9.0, and
  
   iOS 4
  
  required iTunes 9.2. iTunes 10.5, which is required to sync and activate
  
   iOS 5
  
  , requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 or Leopard on
  
   G4
  
  or
  
   G5
  
  computers on 800 MHz or higher; versions 10.3 and 10.4 and 10.5–10.5.7 are no longer supported.
 
  From September 9, 2014, all new iPhone models released were expected to include a new mobile wallet feature developed in conjunction with major credit card issuers
  
   American Express
  
  ,
  
   MasterCard
  
  , and
  
   Visa
  
  .
  

    [180]
   

  Support was later added for
  
   Discover
  


    [181]
   

  and
  
   UnionPay
  


    [182]
   

  cards.
 
  The
  
   interface
  
  is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time. Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.
  

    [183]
   

  However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing the open application in the process.
  

    [184]
   


  By default, the Home screen contains the following icons: Messages (
  
   SMS
  
  and
  
   MMS
  
  messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps (
  
   Google Maps
  
  ), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings,
  
   iTunes (store)
  
  ,
  
   App Store
  
  , (on the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4)
  
   Compass
  
  , FaceTime and GameCenter were added in iOS 4.0 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, as well as the iPod application split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as an updated version of Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources. iOS 6 also added a Clock application onto the iPad's homescreen. YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application. Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for
  
   Phone
  
  ,
  
   Mail
  
  ,
  
   Safari
  
  (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.
  

    [185]
   

  On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create "Web Clips", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.
  

    [110]
   


  Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for
  
   iPhone 2G
  
  ,
  
   3G
  
  ,
  
   4
  
  and
  
   4S
  
  , while each home screen for
  
   iPhone 5
  
  holds up to twenty-four icons due to a larger screen display, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as
  
   Spotlight
  
  , to the left of the first home screen.
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   


  Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using
  
   multi-touch
  
  . The iPhone's
  
   interaction techniques
  
  enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "
  
   pinching
  
  ".
 
  Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.
 
  Other
  
   user-centered
  

   interactive
  
  effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.
 
  The iPhone allows audio
  
   conferencing
  
  , call holding, call merging,
  
   caller ID
  
  , and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended.
 
  The
  
   proximity sensor
  
  shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support
  
   video calling
  
  or
  
   videoconferencing
  
  on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.
  

    [186]
   


  The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls
  
   FaceTime
  
  .
  

    [187]
   

  Voice control, introduced in the iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it.
  

    [188]
   

  The first two models only support
  
   voice dialing
  
  through third-party applications.
  

    [189]
   


  The iPhone includes a
  
   visual voicemail
  
  (in some countries)
  

    [190]
   

  feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.
 
  A music
  
   ringtone
  
  feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be 3 to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or
  
   loop continuously
  
  . All customizing can be done in iTunes,
  

    [191]
   

  or with Apple's
  
   GarageBand
  
  software 4.1.1 or later (available only on
  
   Mac OS X
  
  )
  

    [192]
   

  or third-party tools.
  

    [193]
   


  With the release of
  
   iOS 6
  
  , which was released on September 19, 2012, Apple added features that enable the user to have options to decline a phone call when a person is calling them. The user can reply with a message, or to set a reminder to call them back at a later time.
  

    [194]
   


  The layout of the music library is similar to that of an
  
   iPod
  
  or current
  
   Symbian
  

   S60
  
  phones. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos,
  
   playlists
  
  ,
  
   genres
  
  , composers,
  
   podcasts
  
  ,
  
   audiobooks
  
  , and
  
   compilations
  
  . Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from
  
   iTunes
  
  . The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.
 
  Users can rotate their device horizontally to
  
   landscape mode
  
  to access
  
   Cover Flow
  
  . Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a
  
   Genius playlist
  
  .
  

    [188]
   


  The iPhone supports
  
   gapless playback
  
  .
  

    [195]
   

  Like the
  
   fifth-generation iPods
  
  introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play
  
   digital video
  
  , allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in
  
   widescreen
  
  . Double-tapping switches between widescreen and
  
   fullscreen
  
  video playback.
 
  The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but now since 2012, can use the cellular data network if one is not available.
  

    [196]
   


  The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the
  
   camera
  
  . The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from
  
   iPhoto
  
  or
  
   Aperture
  
  on a Mac, or
  
   Photoshop
  
  on a Windows PC.
 
  Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  or a wide area
  
   GSM
  
  or
  
   EDGE
  
  network, both second-generation (
  
   2G
  
  ) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation
  
   UMTS
  
  and
  
   HSDPA
  
  3.6,
  

    [197]
   

  the iPhone 4S introduced support for
  
   HSUPA
  
  networks (14.4 Mbit/s), and support for HSDPA 7.2 was introduced in the iPhone 3GS .
  

    [198]
   

  Networks accessible from iPhone models include
  
   1xRTT
  
  (represented by a 1x on the status bar) and
  
   GPRS
  
  (shown as GPRS on the status bar),
  
   EDGE
  
  (shown as a capital E on the status bar),
  
   UMTS
  
  and
  
   EV-DO
  
  (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown as a 4G symbol on the status bar), and
  
   LTE
  
  (shown as LTE on the status bar).
  

    [199]
   


  AT&T introduced
  
   3G
  
  in July 2004,
  

    [200]
   

  but as late as 2007,
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone.
  

    [105]
   



    [201]
   

  Support for
  
   802.1X
  
  , an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update.
  

    [202]
   


  By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.
  

    [203]
   

  The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.
  

    [204]
   

  Similarly, the iPhone 3G and onwards prefer
  
   3G
  
  to
  
   2G
  
  , and Wi-Fi to either.
  

    [205]
   


  Wi-Fi,
  
   Bluetooth
  
  , and 3G (on the iPhone 3G onwards) can all be deactivated individually.
  
   Airplane mode
  
  disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.
 
  The iPhone 3GS has a maximum download rate of 7.2
  
   Mbit/s
  
  .
  

    [206]
   

  Furthermore, email attachments as well as apps and media from Apple's various stores must be smaller than 20 MB to be downloaded over a cellular network.
  

    [207]
   

  Larger files, often email attachments or podcasts, must be downloaded over Wi-Fi (which has no file size limits). If Wi-Fi is unavailable, one
  
   workaround
  
  is to open the files directly in
  
   Safari
  
  .
  

    [208]
   


  Safari is the iPhone's native
  
   web browser
  
  , and it displays pages similar to its Mac and Windows counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.
  

    [209]
   



    [210]
   

  Safari does not allow file downloads except for predefined extensions. The iPhone does not support
  
   Flash
  
  .
  

    [211]
   


  Consequently, the
  
   UK's Advertising Standards Authority
  
  adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access "all parts of the internet" should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of
  
   false advertising
  
  . In a rare public letter in April 2010, Apple CEO
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and
  
   iPad
  
  ).
  

    [212]
   

  The iPhone supports
  
   SVG
  
  ,
  
   CSS
  
  ,
  
   HTML
  

   Canvas
  
  , and
  
   Bonjour
  
  .
  

    [213]
   



   Google Chrome
  
  was introduced to the iOS on June 26, 2012. In a review by
  
   Chitika
  
  on July 18, 2012, they announced that the Google Chrome web browser has 1.5% of the iOS web browser market since its release.
  

    [214]
   


  The Maps application can access
  
   Google Maps
  
  in map,
  
   satellite
  
  , or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby
  
   Starbucks
  
  locations and then placing a
  
   prank call
  
  to one with a single tap.
  

    [215]
   



    [216]
   

  Support for walking directions, public transit, and
  
   street view
  
  was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.
  

    [217]
   


  The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass.
  

    [218]
   

  Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the
  
   H.264
  
  codec. Simple weather and
  
   stock quotes
  
  applications also tap into the Internet.
 
  IPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places. According to
  
   Google
  
  , in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.
  

    [219]
   

  According to
  
   Deutsche Telekom
  
  CEO René Obermann, "The average
  
   Internet usage
  
  for an iPhone customer is more than 100
  
   megabytes
  
  . This is 30 times the use for our average contract-based consumer customers."
  

    [220]
   


   Nielsen
  
  found that 98% of iPhone users use data services, and 88% use the internet.
  

    [40]
   

  In China, the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS were built and distributed without Wi-Fi.
  

    [221]
   


  With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone was brought to the public's attention. Under the two US carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on AT&T networks, whereas Verizon networks only support the use of each separately.
  

    [222]
   


  However, in 2014, Verizon announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would allow simultaneous voice and data over its LTE Network.

  T-Mobile and Sprint have enabled calls over Wi-Fi, with Verizon and AT&T soon doing the same.
  

    [223]
   


  For text input, the iPhone implements a
  
   virtual keyboard
  
  on the touchscreen. It has automatic
  
   spell checking
  
  and correction,
  
   predictive word
  
  capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.
  

    [224]
   


  The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in
  
   landscape mode
  
  , which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a
  
   magnifying glass
  
  , allowing users to place the
  
   cursor
  
  in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.
  

    [225]
   


  Alternate characters with accents (for example, letters from the alphabets of other languages) and
  
   emoji
  
  can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for 2 seconds and selecting the alternate character from the popup.
  

    [226]
   

  The 3.0 update brought support for
  
   cut, copy, or pasting
  
  text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   

  On iPhone 4S and above, Siri allows dictation.
 
  The iPhone also features an email program that supports
  
   HTML email
  
  , which enables the user to embed photos in an email message.
  
   PDF
  
  ,
  
   Word
  
  ,
  
   Excel
  
  , and
  
   PowerPoint
  
  attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.
  

    [227]
   


   Yahoo!
  
  offers a free push-email service for the iPhone.
  
   IMAP
  
  (although not
  
   Push-IMAP
  
  ) and
  
   POP3
  
  mail standards are also supported, including
  
   Microsoft Exchange
  


    [228]
   

  and
  
   Kerio Connect
  
  .
  

    [229]
   


  In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server. Apple has also licensed
  
   Microsoft ActiveSync
  
  and supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware.
  

    [230]
   



    [231]
   

  The iPhone will sync email account settings over from Apple's own
  
   Mail
  
  application,
  
   Microsoft Outlook
  
  , and
  
   Microsoft Entourage
  
  , or it can be manually configured on the device itself. The email program can access almost any IMAP or POP3 account.
  

    [232]
   


  Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to
  
   iChat
  
  ) under each recipient's name. The iPhone has built-in support for email message forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending. Support for multi-recipient SMS was added in the 1.1.3 software update.
  

    [233]
   

  Support for
  
   MMS
  
  was added in the 3.0 update, but not for the original first generation iPhone
  

    [114]
   



    [115]
   

  and not in the US until September 25, 2009.
  

    [234]
   



    [235]
   


  At
  
   WWDC 2007
  
  on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support
  
   third-party
  
  web applications using
  
   Ajax
  
  that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.
  

    [236]
   

  On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's "Hot News"
  
   weblog
  
  , announced that a
  
   software development kit
  
  (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.
  

    [237]
   


  It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an "iPhone simulator". However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an
  
   Apple Developer Connection
  
  membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the
  
   App Store
  
  , of which they will receive a 70% share.
  

    [238]
   


  Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.
  

    [231]
   

  The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.
  

    [239]
   


  Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution. Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example,
  
   I Am Rich
  
  , a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user.
  

    [240]
   

  Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected
  
   Podcaster
  
  , which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes.
  

    [241]
   

  Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability.
  

    [217]
   


  NetShare, another rejected app, would have enabled users to
  
   tether
  
  their iPhone to a laptop or desktop, using its cellular network to load data for the computer.
  

    [242]
   

  Many carriers of the iPhone later globally allowed tethering before Apple officially supported it with the upgrade to the iOS 3.0, with
  
   AT&T Mobility
  
  being a relative latecomer in the United States.
  

    [243]
   

  In most cases, the carrier charges extra for tethering an iPhone.
 
  Before the SDK was released, third parties were permitted to design "Web Apps" that would run through Safari.
  

    [244]
   

  Unsigned native applications are also available for "jailbroken" phones.
  

    [245]
   

  The ability to install native applications onto the iPhone outside of the App Store is not supported by Apple, the stated reason being that such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than those that perform SIM unlocking.
  

    [246]
   


  As of October 2013
  

    [update]
   

  , Apple has passed 60 billion app downloads.
  

    [247]
   

  As of September 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , there have been over 140 billion app downloads from the App Store.
  

    [248]
   


  The iPhone has received positive reviews. In its launch year, it was called "revolutionary",
  

    [249]
   

  while newer iterations have received praise, such as being called "the best phone".
  

    [250]
   


  The iPhone attracts users of all ages,
  

    [40]
   

  and besides consumer use, the iPhone has also been adopted for
  
   business purposes
  
  .
  

    [251]
   


  Starting with the iPhone 4S, Apple added an
  
   accessibility
  
  feature to optimize the function of the iPhone with
  
   hearing aids
  
  .
  

    [252]
   

  Apple released a program of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.
  

    [253]
   

  These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience and allow the user to manage the hearing aid right from your iPhone. Made for iPhone hearing aids also feature
  
   Live Listen
  
  . With Live Listen the iPhone acts as a remote
  
   microphone
  
  that sends sound to a Made for iPhone hearing aid. Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.
  

    [254]
   


  The
  
   Braille Displays
  
  for iOS program was announced by Apple coinciding with the release of the iPhone 3GS,
  
   iPad
  
  and
  
   iPod Touch (3rd Generation)
  
  . This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless braille displays that work with iOS out of the box. The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with
  
   VoiceOver
  
  without any additional software. iOS supports
  
   braille tables
  
  for more than 25 languages.
  

    [255]
   


  IPhone lets the user know when an alert is sent to the it, in a variety of notice methods. It delivers both
  
   visual
  
  and
  
   vibrating alerts
  
  for incoming phone and
  
   FaceTime
  
  calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an
  
   LED light flash
  
  for incoming calls and alerts. Or have incoming calls display a photo of the caller. Users can choose from different vibration patterns or even create their own.
  

    [256]
   


  The iPhone can enlarge text to make it more
  
   accessible
  
  for vision-impaired users,
  

    [257]
   

  and can accommodate hearing-impaired users with
  
   closed captioning
  
  and external
  
   TTY
  
  devices.
  

    [258]
   

  The iPhone 3GS also features white on black mode,
  
   VoiceOver
  
  (a
  
   screen reader
  
  ), and zooming for impaired vision, and mono audio for
  
   limited hearing
  
  in one ear.
  

    [259]
   

  Apple regularly publishes Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates which explicitly state compliance with the US regulation "
  
   Section 508
  
  ".
  

    [260]
   


  With the release of the newer iOS 9 for all iPhones, users now have the ability to choose between 2 different screen view options. The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.
 
  AssistiveTouch helps to adapt the
  
   Multi-Touch
  
  screen of an iOS device to your unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a
  
   wheelchair
  
  .
  

    [256]
   


  Guided Access helps people with
  
   autism
  
  or other
  
   attention
  
  and
  
   sensory challenges
  
  stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button, and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can even restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen. So wandering taps and gestures won’t distract from learning.
  

    [256]
   


  As of September 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , 15 different iPhone models have been produced. The models in
  
   bold
  
  are the current flagship devices of the series:
 


  Apple has filed more than 200
  
   patent applications
  
  related to the technology behind the iPhone.
  

    [262]
   



    [263]
   


  LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the
  
   LG Prada
  
  . Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&D Center, said at a press conference: "we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006."
  

    [264]
   


  On September 3, 1993,
  
   Infogear
  
  filed for the US trademark "I PHONE"
  

    [265]
   

  and on March 20, 1996, applied for the trademark "IPhone".
  

    [266]
   

  "I Phone" was registered in March 1998,
  

    [265]
   

  and "IPhone" was registered in 1999.
  

    [266]
   

  Since then, the I PHONE mark had been abandoned.
  

    [265]
   

  Infogear trademarks cover "communications terminals comprising computer hardware and software providing integrated telephone, data communications and personal computer functions" (1993 filing),
  

    [265]
   

  and "computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks" (1996 filing).
  

    [267]
   


  Infogear released a telephone with an integrated web browser under the name
  
   iPhone
  
  in 1998.
  

    [268]
   

  In 2000, Infogear won an infringement claim against the owners of the iphones.com domain name.
  

    [269]
   

  In June 2000,
  
   Cisco Systems
  
  acquired Infogear, including the iPhone trademark.
  

    [270]
   

  On December 18, 2006, they released a range of re-branded
  
   Voice over IP
  
  (VoIP) sets under the name iPhone.
  

    [271]
   


  In October 2002, Apple applied for the "iPhone" trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006. As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted.
 
  In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an "iPhone" trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago.
  

    [272]
   

  As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.
  

    [273]
   

  The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called
  
   Comwave
  
  who themselves applied for the trademark three months later. Comwave has been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004.
  

    [270]
   


  Shortly after Steve Jobs' January 9, 2007 announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before.
  

    [274]
   

  On January 10, 2007, Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name.
  

    [275]
   

  More recently,
  
   [
   


      when?
     


   ]
  
  Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a "minor skirmish" that was not about money, but about interoperability.
  

    [276]
   


  On February 2, 2007, Apple and Cisco announced that they had agreed to temporarily suspend litigation while they held settlement talks,
  

    [277]
   

  and subsequently announced on February 20, 2007, that they had reached an agreement. Both companies will be allowed to use the "iPhone" name
  

    [278]
   

  in exchange for "exploring interoperability" between their security, consumer, and business communications products.
  

    [279]
   


  The iPhone has also inspired several leading high-tech clones,
  

    [280]
   

  driving both the popularity of Apple and consumer willingness to upgrade iPhones quickly.
  

    [281]
   


  On October 22, 2009,
  
   Nokia
  
  filed a lawsuit against Apple for infringement of its GSM, UMTS and WLAN patents. Nokia alleges that Apple has been violating ten Nokia patents since the iPhone initial release.
  

    [282]
   


  In December 2010,
  
   Reuters
  
  reported that some iPhone and
  
   iPad
  
  users were suing
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission. Some makers of the applications such as Textplus4,
  
   Paper Toss
  
  ,
  
   The Weather Channel
  
  ,
  
   Dictionary.com
  
  , Talking Tom Cat and Pumpkin Maker have also been named as co-defendants in the lawsuit.
  

    [283]
   


  In August 2012, Apple won a
  
   smartphone patent lawsuit
  
  in the U.S. against
  
   Samsung
  
  , the world's largest maker of smartphones,
  

    [284]
   

  however on December 6, 2016,
  
   SCOTUS
  
  reversed the decision that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard to define "article of manufacture" because it is not the smartphone itself but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate.
  

    [285]
   


  In March 2013, an Apple patent for a wraparound display was revealed.
  

    [286]
   


  Since April 20, 2011, a
  
   hidden
  

   unencrypted
  
  file on the iPhone and other iOS devices has been widely discussed in the media.
  

    [287]
   



    [288]
   

  It was alleged that the file, labeled "consolidated.db", constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by
  
   triangulating nearby cell phone towers
  
  , a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.
  

    [289]
   

  The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple
  
   iOS4
  
  and may contain almost a year's worth of data. Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called "h-cells.plist".
  

    [290]
   



   F-Secure
  
  discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and
  
   Skyhook
  
  through
  
   wardriving
  
  .
  

    [291]
   

  Nevertheless, unlike the
  
   Google
  
  "Latitude" application, which performs a similar task on
  
   Android
  
  phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific
  
   EULA
  
  or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long
  
   terms and conditions
  
  of the iPhone that "Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device".
  

    [292]
   


  The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone. An
  
   open source
  
  application named "iPhoneTracker", which turns the data stored in the file into a visual map, was made available to the public in April 2011.
  

    [293]
   

  While the file cannot be erased without
  
   jailbreaking
  
  the phone, it can be encrypted.
  

    [294]
   


  Apple gave an official response on their web site on April 27, 2011,
  

    [295]
   

  after questions were submitted by users, the
  
   Associated Press
  
  and others. Apple clarified that the data is a small portion of their crowd-sourced location database cache of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone for making location services faster than with only GPS, therefore the data does not represent the locations of the iPhone. The volume of data retained was an error. Apple issued an update for iOS (version
  
   4.3.3
  
  , or
  
   4.2.8
  
  for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off.
  

    [295]
   

  The upload to Apple can also be selectively disabled from "System services", "Cell Network Search." Regardless, in July 2014, a report on state-owned China Central Television labeled the iPhone a "national security concern."
  

    [296]
   


  A feature that can be found under "location services" in the settings of the iPhone has also been found to be secretly tracking the user's information. This feature is called "frequent locations" and it can either be kept on or turned off. This feature is said to help the accuracy of the GPS and Apple Maps since it can log information about the locations the user has frequently visited. However, this feature also keeps track of the number of times that he/she has been to that location, the dates, and the exact times. A lot of people have found this feature to be intrusive of their personal lives and have since then had an option to keep it on or shut it off.
  

    [297]
   


  It was revealed as a part of the
  
   2013 mass surveillance disclosures
  
  that the American and British intelligence agencies, the
  
   National Security Agency
  
  (NSA) and the
  
   Government Communications Headquarters
  
  (GCHQ) have access to the user data in iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android phones, respectively. They can read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.
  

    [298]
   


  According to a
  

    The New York Times
   

  article titled "Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A.", Apple has developed a new encryption method for iOS 8, described as "so deep that Apple could no longer comply with government warrants asking for customer information to be extracted from devices."
  

    [299]
   


  Throughout 2015, prosecutors in the United States argued for the U.S. government to be able to compel decryption of iPhone contents.
  

    [300]
   



    [301]
   



    [302]
   



    [303]
   

  After the
  
   2015 San Bernardino attack
  
  , the
  
   FBI
  
  recovered an
  
   iPhone 5C
  
  that was issued to one of the shooters by his employer, and
  
   iCloud
  
  backups of that phone from a month and a half before the shooting. (The shooters had destroyed their personal phones.) The U.S. government attempted to use the arcane and outdated
  
   All Writs Act
  
  to obtain a court order ordering Apple to produce an
  
   IPSW
  
  file that would allow investigators to brute force the passcode of the iPhone, which would equate to modernized slavery.
  

    [304]
   



    [305]
   



    [306]
   


   Tim Cook
  
  responded on the company's website, outlining a need for encryption, arguing that if they produce a
  
   backdoor
  
  for one device, it would inevitably be used to compromise the privacy of other iPhone users.
  

    [307]
   

  On February 19, Apple communicated to journalists that the password for the Apple ID for the iPhone had been changed within a day of the government obtaining it, preventing Apple from producing a workaround that would only target older devices.
  

    [308]
   


   See
  

   FBI–Apple encryption dispute
  
  .
 
  As of April 2016, Apple's Privacy Policy addresses requests from government agencies for access to customers' data: "Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a “backdoor” in any of our products or services. We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will."
  

    [309]
   

  In 2015 the
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  awarded Apple 5 out of 5 stars “commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy.”
  

    [310]
   


  Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. According to
  
   Jonathan Zittrain
  
  , the emergence of
  
   closed devices
  
  like the iPhone have made computing more
  
   proprietary
  
  than early versions of
  
   Microsoft Windows
  
  .
  

    [311]
   


  The
  
   hacker
  
  community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and make it difficult or impossible to obtain warranty service.

  " allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality. SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network.
  

    [313]
   

  However, in the United States, Apple cannot void an iPhone's warranty unless it can show that a problem or component failure is linked to the installation or placement of an after-market item such as unauthorized applications, because of the
  
   Federal Trade Commission
  
  's
  
   Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975
  
  .
  

    [314]
   


  The iPhone also has an area and settings where users can set restrictions or parental controls
  

    [315]
   

  on apps that can be downloaded or used within the iPhone. The restrictions area requires a password.
  

    [316]
   


  The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007,
  
   Jon Lech Johansen
  
  reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.
  

    [317]
   


  Unlike the first generation iPhone, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries.
  

    [318]
   

  This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack. The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide
  
   overload
  
  of Apple's
  
   servers
  
  on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as
  
   MobileMe
  
  were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate it, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable.
  

    [319]
   


  Users on the
  
   O2
  
  network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model.
  

    [320]
   

  Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience. In the US, Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement.
  
   Best Buy
  
  and
  
   Walmart
  
  will also sell the iPhone.
  

    [321]
   


  The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved
  
   cryptographic signature
  
  . This restriction can be overcome by "jailbreaking" the phone,
  

    [322]
   

  which involves replacing the iPhone's
  
   firmware
  
  with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's
  
   technical protection measures
  
  .
  

    [323]
   

  Apple, in a statement to the
  
   United States Copyright Office
  
  in response to
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  (EFF) lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be
  
   copyright infringement
  
  due to the necessary modification of system software.
  

    [324]
   

  However, in 2010, Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the United States by the
  
   DMCA
  
  .
  

    [325]
   

  Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported.
  

    [326]
   



    [327]
   


  iOS and
  
   Android
  
  2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a jailbroken iPhone with the help of
  
   OpeniBoot
  
  or iDroid.
  

    [328]
   



    [329]
   


  In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called
  
   JailbreakMe
  
  that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering to
  
   jailbreak
  
  the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps).
  

    [330]
   



    [331]
   



    [332]
   

  Each of these exploits were quickly fixed by iOS updates from Apple. Theoretically these flaws could have also been used for malicious purposes.
  

    [333]
   


  In July 2011, Apple released iOS 4.3.5 (4.2.10 for CDMA iPhone) to fix a security vulnerability with certificate validation.
  

    [334]
   


  Following the release of the iPhone 5S model, a group of German hackers called the
  
   Chaos Computer Club
  
  announced on September 21, 2013, that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using "easy everyday means." The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image as verification. The spokesman for the group stated: "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token."

  Most iPhones were and are still sold with a
  
   SIM lock
  
  , which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized
  
   GSM
  
  phones. Unlike most GSM phones however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code. The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers per
  
   IMEI
  
  and is set when the iPhone is activated.
  

    [337]
   


  While the iPhone was initially
  
   sold in the US only on the AT&T network
  
  with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to "
  
   unlock
  
  " the phone from a specific network.
  

    [338]
   

  Although AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States, unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers.
  

    [339]
   

  For example, an unlocked iPhone may be used on the T-Mobile network in the US but, while an unlocked iPhone is compatible with T-Mobile's
  
   voice
  
  network, it may not be able to make use of 3G functionality (i.e. no mobile web or e-mail, etc.).

  More than a quarter of the original 1st generation iPhones sold in the US were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.
  

    [39]
   



    [341]
   


  On March 26, 2009, AT&T in the United States began selling the iPhone without a contract, though still SIM-locked to their network.
  

    [342]
   

  The up-front purchase price of such iPhone units is often twice as expensive as those bundled with contracts.
  

    [343]
   


  Outside of the United States, policies differ, especially in US territories and insular areas like
  
   Guam
  
  ;
  
   GTA Teleguam
  
  was the exclusive carrier for the iPhone since its introduction, as none of the four US carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) have a presence in the area.
  

    [344]
   

  Since 2013,
  
   Docomo Pacific
  
  ended GTA's exclusivity starting with the iPhone 5.
  

    [345]
   


  Beginning April 8, 2012, AT&T began offering a factory SIM unlock option (which Apple calls a "whitelisting", allowing it to be used on any carrier the phone supports) for iPhone owners.
  

    [346]
   


  It has been reported that all of the Verizon 4G LTE phones come factory unlocked. After such discovery, Verizon announced that all of their 4G LTE phones, including iPhones, would remain unlocked. This is due to the regulations that the FCC has placed on the 700 MHz C-Block spectrum, which is used by Verizon.

  In the United Kingdom,
  
   O2
  
  ,
  
   EE
  
  ,
  
   3
  
  ,
  
   Vodafone
  
  , and
  
   Tesco Mobile
  
  sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go. They are locked to the network initially, though they can usually be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee (with the exception of the
  
   3
  
  network, which will unlock the device at any time for no charge).
  

    [348]
   

  However, all current versions of iPhone are available for purchase
  
   SIM-free
  
  from the Apple Store or Apple's Online Store, consequently, they are unlocked for use on any GSM network too.
  

    [349]
   


  Four major carriers in Australia (
  
   Optus
  
  ,
  
   Telstra
  
  ,
  
   Virgin Mobile
  
  , and
  
   Vodafone
  
  )
  

    [350]
   

  offer legitimate unlocking, now at no cost for all iPhone devices, both current and prior models.
 
  Internationally, policies vary, but many carriers sell the iPhone unlocked for full retail price.

  In 2003, four years before the iPhone was officially introduced, the trademark iFone was registered in
  
   Mexico
  
  by a communications systems and services company, iFone.
  

    [351]
   

  Apple tried to gain control over its brandname, but a Mexican court denied the request. The case began in 2009, when the Mexican firm sued Apple. The Supreme court of Mexico upheld that iFone is the rightful owner and held that Apple iPhone is a trademark violation.
  

    [352]
   


  In
  
   Brazil
  
  the brand IPHONE was registered in 2000 by the company then called Gradiente Eletrônica S.A., now IGB Eletrônica S.A. According to the filing, Gradiente foresaw the revolution in the convergence of voice and data over the Internet at the time.
  

    [353]
   


  In Brazil, the final battle over the brandname concluded in 2008. On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market.
  

    [353]
   

  In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as "Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletrônica, not Apple, owned the "iPhone" mark in Brazil. The "iPhone" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple’s release of its first iPhone. This decision came 3 months after Gradiente Eletrônica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand.
  

    [354]
   


  In June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brandname in Brazil. The court ruling determined that the Gradiente's registration does not own exclusive rights on the brand. Although Gradiente intended to appeal, with the decision Apple can use freely the brand without paying royalties to the Brazilian company.

  In the
  
   Philippines
  
  , Solid Group launched the
  
   MyPhone
  
  brand in 2007. Stylized as "my|phone", Solid Broadband filed a trademark application of that brand. Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for "confusingly similar" to the iPhone and that it may likely "deceive" or "cause confusion" among consumers.
 
  However, on May 19, 2015, Apple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group. The decision was signed by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the "iPhone" and the "MyPhone". "This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark," Arevalo later added.
  

    [356]
   



    [357]
   


  Solid Broadband noted that Apple can still appeal the IPO's decision within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the decision. The decision becomes final and executory if no appeal is filed on time.
