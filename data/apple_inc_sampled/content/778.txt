   MacPaint
  
  is a
  
   raster graphics editor
  
  developed by
  
   Apple Computer
  
  and released with the original
  
   Macintosh
  

   personal computer
  
  on January 24, 1984. It was sold separately for
  
   US$
  
  195 with its
  
   word processor
  
  counterpart,
  
   MacWrite
  
  .
  

    [1]
   

  MacPaint was notable because it could generate graphics that could be used by other applications. Using the
  
   mouse
  
  , and the
  
   clipboard
  
  and
  
   QuickDraw
  
  picture language, pictures could be cut from MacPaint and pasted into MacWrite documents.
  

    [2]
   

  Pictures could also be cut from MacPaint and pasted into the resource fork of any application via
  
   ResEdit
  
  , allowing application
  
   internationalization
  
  .
 
  The original MacPaint was developed by
  
   Bill Atkinson
  
  , a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team.
  

    [3]
   

  Early development versions of MacPaint were called MacSketch, still retaining part of the name of its roots, LisaSketch.
  

    [4]
   

  It was later developed by
  
   Claris
  
  , the software subsidiary of Apple which was formed in 1987. The last version of MacPaint was version 2.0, released in 1988. It was discontinued by Claris in 1998 because of diminishing sales.

  MacPaint was written by
  
   Bill Atkinson
  
  , a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team.
  

    [3]
   

  The original MacPaint consisted of 5,804 lines of
  
   Pascal
  

   computer code
  
  , augmented by another 2,738 lines of
  
   68000
  

   assembly language
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  MacPaint's user interface was designed by
  
   Susan Kare
  
  , also a member of the Macintosh team.
  

    [7]
   

  Kare also beta-tested MacPaint before release.
  

    [7]
   


  MacPaint uses two offscreen
  
   memory buffers
  
  to avoid flicker when dragging shapes or images across the screen.
  

    [8]
   

  One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, and the other contained the pixels of its previous state.
  

    [8]
   

  The second buffer was used as the basis of the software's
  
   undo
  
  feature.
  

    [8]
   

  In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint.
  

    [9]
   

  The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.
 
  The original MacPaint did not incorporate a zoom function. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle with a white border. The FatBits editing mode set the standard for many future editors.
  

    [10]
   

  MacPaint included a "Goodies" menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the "Aids" menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed "Goodies" as public awareness of the
  
   AIDS
  
  epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.
  

    [11]
   


  MacPaint was first advertised in an 18-page brochure in December 1983, following the earlier announcement of the
  
   Macintosh 128K
  
  .
  

    [12]
   

  The Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984 with two applications, MacPaint and
  
   MacWrite
  
  . For a special post-election edition of
  

    Newsweek
   

  in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue. The Newsweek advertisement included many pages dedicated to explaining how MacWrite and MacPaint worked together.
  

    [13]
   

  After launch, a
  

    New York Times
   

  reviewer noted how MacPaint unfolded numerous graphic possibilities for the personal computer; he went further to say "it is better than anything else of its kind offered on personal computers by a factor of 10."
  

    [2]
   


  MacPaint 2.0 was released on January 11, 1988 by
  
   Claris
  
  .
  

    [14]
   

  It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously.
  

    [15]
   

  The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a non-movable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10".
  

    [15]
   

  Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents.
  

    [15]
   

  MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris.
  

    [16]
   

  MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint.
  

    [15]
   

  Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989.
  

    [17]
   

  Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales.
  

    [5]
   

  There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished to be able to use the program.
 
  Since 2010 MacPaint 1.3's
  
   source code
  
  (written in a combination of
  
   Assembly
  
  and
  
   Pascal
  
  ) is available through the
  
   Computer History Museum
  
  ,
  

    [18]
   

  along with the
  
   QuickDraw
  
  source code, a library to draw bitmapped graphics,
  

    [19]
   

  due to the support of Steve Jobs.
  

    [20]
   


  MacPaint inspired other companies to release similar products for other platforms;
  

    [21]
   

  within a year a half-dozen
  
   clones
  
  existed for the Apple II and IBM PC.
  

    [22]
   

  Some of these included
  
   Broderbund
  
  's
  
   Dazzle Draw
  
  for the Apple II, Mouse Systems' PC Paint for the PC, and
  
   IBM
  
  's Color Paint for the
  
   IBM PCjr
  
  .
