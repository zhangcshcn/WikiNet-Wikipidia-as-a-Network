   Claris
  
  was a computer
  
   software developer
  
  formed as a spin-off from
  
   Apple Computer
  
  (now Apple Inc.) in 1987. It was given the
  
   source code
  
  and
  
   copyrights
  
  to several programs that were owned by Apple, notably
  
   MacWrite
  
  and
  
   MacPaint
  
  , in order to separate Apple's application software activities from its
  
   hardware
  
  and
  
   operating systems
  
  activities.
 
  In 1998 the company divested itself of all but its flagship product, and reformed as
  
   FileMaker Inc.
  



  During the early days of the
  
   Macintosh
  
  computer, Apple shipped the machines with two basic programs, MacWrite and MacPaint, so that users would have a working machine "out of the box". However, this resulted in complaints from third-party developers, who felt that these programs were good enough for so many users that there was little reason to buy something better.

  Apple decided to allow the programs to "wither", so that the third-party developers would have time to write suitable replacements. Unfortunately the developers didn't seem to hold up their end of the bargain, and it was some time before truly capable replacements like
  
   WriteNow
  
  came along. In the meantime users complained about the lack of
  
   upgrades
  
  , while the third-party
  
   developers
  
  continued to complain about the
  
   possibility
  
  of upgrades.
 
  Eventually Apple decided the only solution was to spin off the products to a third party of its own creation, forming Claris in 1987. Claris was also given the rights to several lesser-known Apple products such as
  
   MacProject
  
  ,
  
   MacDraw
  
  , and the hit
  
   Apple II
  
  product
  
   AppleWorks
  
  . Claris' second corporate headquarters (nicknamed "The Wedge") was in
  
   Santa Clara
  
  , about six miles from the main Apple campus.
 
  At first Claris provided only trivial upgrades, limited to making the products continue to run on newer versions of the
  
   Macintosh operating system
  
  . In 1988, Claris purchased
  
   FileMaker
  
  from
  
   Nashoba Systems
  
  and quickly released a rebranded version called FileMaker II. In the meantime, development began on major overhauls of their entire product line, including FileMaker. Each of these would be eventually released as part of the Pro series of products.
 
  In 1990, Apple decided that Claris should remain a wholly owned
  
   subsidiary
  
  , as opposed to being completely spun off in an
  
   initial public offering
  
  . The company president soon left, and over the next year most of the other executives followed.
 
  That same year Claris also purchased an integrated application written by two former Claris employees. After rebranding in a style similar to FileMaker, MacDraw, and MacWrite, it was released in 1991 as
  
   ClarisWorks
  
  , and became another huge success for the company. After a lengthy series of ups and downs, this product was eventually taken back by Apple in 1998 and rebranded as
  
   AppleWorks
  
  (for Macintosh).
 
  In the late 1980s, Claris began a major upgrade effort, rewriting all of its products to use a more modern and common user interface. The result was the "Pro" series: MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. In order to provide a complete
  
   office suite
  
  they later purchased the rights to the
  
   Informix WingZ
  

   spreadsheet
  
  on the Mac, rebranding it as
  
   Claris Resolve
  
  , and added the new
  
   presentation program
  

   Claris Impact
  
  .
 
  The series was released piecemeal over a period of about two years, during which period
  
   Microsoft
  
  was able to dominate the market with
  
   Microsoft Word
  
  and
  
   Microsoft Excel
  
  . While the Claris packages were arguably much more "approachable" than the Microsoft applications, the Claris software applications lacked some features of the now-mature Microsoft suite, leaving them lacking in "checkbox features." Their value was further eroded by aggressive bundling deals from Microsoft that could allow Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to be purchased for a cost not much higher than MacWrite aloneâ€”a bundle that Claris did not match. Claris did offer ClarisWorks, an all-in-one package; and, while the price was right, ClarisWorks was very limited and could not compete in the business market. Microsoft also released a
  
   Works
  
  package.
 
  Microsoft's domination of the Macintosh
  
   office suite
  
  software marketplace would be replicated five years later when (following the release of
  
   Windows 95
  
  ),
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  crushed its two main rivals in Windows software: the
  
   WordPerfect
  
  /
  
   Quattro Pro
  
  suite and the
  
   Lotus SmartSuite
  
  .
 
  By the late 1980s,
  
   HyperCard
  
  needed updating as well but Apple management did not see any value in the product and let it wither. Complaints eventually became loud enough that they decided
  
   something
  
  had to be done. Studying the problem, they decided that all software should be released through Claris, and sent HyperCard and the Mac OS to them. Many of the developers refused to move to Claris, leading to a serious split in development that delayed future releases of both products. The Mac OS was soon returned to Apple; HyperCard was ignored for a time, before also returning briefly as a part of the
  
   QuickTime
  
  group.
 
  In 1988, Claris published
  
   Claris CAD
  
  , a 2-D CAD package, and Claris Graphics Translator, a translation package for Claris CAD.
 
  In early 1989, Claris published SmartForm Designer,
  

    [1]
   

  software to design forms, and a companion product, SmartForm Assistant, software to fill forms created by SmartForm Designer.
 
  In 1994, Claris published
  
   Amazing Animation
  
  , software aimed at children and young teenagers, allowing them to produce their own short animated films.
 
  In 1995 Claris purchased and released
  
   Claris Home Page
  
  , which enjoyed popularity as one of the few truly
  
   GUI
  
  -based
  
   WYSIWYG
  

   HTML editors
  
  of the time.
 
  Other products added to the line included
  
   Claris Emailer
  
  ,
  
   Claris OfficeMail
  
  , and
  
   Claris Organizer
  
  . These products were part of a new effort to diversify Claris and no longer chase the "office" market which, by this point, was considered a lost cause.
 
  By the mid-1990s it appeared to most observers that Apple was in serious danger of disappearing. The main ClarisWorks development team left Claris, disillusioned with the product and the market, and founded
  
   Gobe Software
  
  , which produced a Claris-like office suite for
  
   BeOS
  
  .
 
  Facing declining sales, Claris management decided that FileMaker was the only product worth keeping, and put all of the rest of the products on indefinite hold. By 1998 the transition was complete and the company renamed itself as
  
   FileMaker Inc.
  
  Claris's only other major product, ClarisWorks, was taken back by Apple to become
  
   AppleWorks
  
  . The company kept FileMaker and Claris HomePage 3.0. The latter was discontinued in 2001 leaving FileMaker as its lone offering until January 8, 2008, when the company released
  
   Bento
  
  , a template-based database application with a leaning toward information from other applications. Bento was later discontinued on September 30, 2013.
