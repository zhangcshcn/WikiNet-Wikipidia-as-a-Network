   MeeGo
  
  was a
  
   Linux distribution
  
  hosted by the
  
   Linux Foundation
  
  , using
  
   source code
  
  from the
  
   operating systems
  

   Moblin
  
  (produced by
  
   Intel
  
  ) and
  
   Maemo
  
  (produced by
  
   Nokia
  
  ).
  

    [1]
   

  Primarily targeted at
  
   mobile devices
  
  and
  
   information appliances
  
  in the
  
   consumer electronics
  
  market, MeeGo was designed to act as an operating system for hardware platforms such as
  
   netbooks
  
  , entry-level desktops,
  
   nettops
  
  ,
  
   tablet computers
  
  ,
  
   mobile computing
  
  and communications devices,
  
   in-vehicle infotainment
  
  devices,
  
   SmartTV / ConnectedTV
  
  ,
  
   IPTV
  
  -boxes,
  
   smart phones
  
  , and other
  
   embedded systems
  
  .

  The Linux Foundation canceled MeeGo in September 2011 in favor of
  
   Tizen
  
  .
  

    [3]
   

  A Finnish start-up,
  
   Jolla
  
  , picked up MeeGo’s community-driven successor
  
   Mer
  


    [4]
   

  to develop a new operating system:
  
   Sailfish OS
  
  , and launched
  
   Jolla Phone
  
  smartphone at the end of 2013.
  

    [5]
   

  All development of MeeGo and its supporting hardware have ceased.
 


  MeeGo T01 was first announced at
  
   Mobile World Congress
  
  in February 2010 by
  
   Intel
  
  and
  
   Nokia
  
  in a joint press conference. The stated aim is to merge the efforts of Intel's
  
   Moblin
  
  and Nokia's
  
   Maemo
  
  former projects into one new common project that would drive a broad third party application ecosystem. According to Intel, MeeGo was developed because
  
   Microsoft
  
  did not offer comprehensive
  
   Windows 7
  
  support for the
  
   Atom processor
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  On February 16, 2010 a tech talk notice was posted about the former Maemo development project founded in 2009 and code named
  
   Harmattan
  
  , that originally slated to become Maemo 6. Those notice stated that Harmattan is now considered to be a MeeGo instance (though not a MeeGo product), and Nokia is giving up the Maemo branding for Harmattan on the
  
   Nokia N9
  
  and beyond. (Any previous Maemo versions up to Maemo 5, a.k.a. Fremantle, will still be referred to as Maemo.) In addition it was made clear that only the naming was given up whilst development on that Harmattan will continue so that any schedules will be met.
  

    [7]
   


  Aminocom and
  
   Novell
  
  also played a large part in the MeeGo effort, working with the Linux Foundation on their build infrastructure and official MeeGo products. Amino was responsible for extending MeeGo to TV devices,
  

    [8]
   

  while Novell was increasingly introducing technology that was originally developed for
  
   openSUSE
  
  , (including
  
   Open Build Service
  
  ,
  
   ZYpp
  
  for
  
   package management
  
  , and other system management tools).
  

    [2]
   



    [9]
   

  In November 2010,
  
   AMD
  
  also joined the alliance of companies that were actively developing MeeGo.
  

    [10]
   


  Quite noticeable changes in the project setup happened on February 11, 2011 when Nokia officially announced to switch over to
  
   Windows Phone
  
  7 and thus abandoning MeeGo and the partnership.
  

    [11]
   


  On 27 September 2011, it was announced by Intel employee Imad Sousou that in collaboration with
  
   Samsung
  
  MeeGo will be replaced by
  
   Tizen
  
  during 2012.
  

    [3]
   



    [12]
   



    [13]
   



    [14]
   



    [15]
   



    [16]
   


  Community developers from the
  
   Mer
  
  project however started to continue MeeGo without Intel and Nokia.
  

    [17]
   



    [18]
   



    [19]
   

  At a later time some of the former MeeGo developers from Nokia headed for founding the company
  
   Jolla
  
  that after some time popped up with a MeeGo and it's free successor
  
   Mer
  
  based OS platform they called
  
   Sailfish OS
  
  .
  

    [20]
   


  MeeGo is intended to run on a variety of hardware platforms including hand-helds, in-car devices, netbooks and televisions.
  

    [21]
   

  All platforms share the MeeGo core, with different
  
   “User Experience”
  
  ("UX") layers for each type of device.
 
  MeeGo provides support for both
  
   ARM
  
  and Intel
  
   x86
  
  processors with
  
   SSSE3
  
  enabled
  

    [22]
   

  and uses
  
   btrfs
  
  as the default
  
   file system
  
  .
  

    [23]
   


  Within the MeeGo project there are several
  
   graphical user interfaces
  
  – internally called
  
   User Experiences
  
  ("UX").
 
  The Netbook UX is a continuation of the
  
   Moblin
  
  interface. It is written using the
  
   Clutter
  
  -based
  
   Mx toolkit
  
  , and uses the
  
   Mutter window manager
  
  .
 
  Samsung Netbook NP-N100 use MeeGo for its operating system.
  

    [24]
   


  MeeGo’s netbook version uses several
  
   Linux
  
  applications in the background, such as
  
   Evolution
  
  (Email, calendar),
  
   Empathy
  
  (instant messaging),
  
   Gwibber
  
  (microblogging),
  
   Chromium
  
  (web browser), and
  
   Banshee
  
  (multimedia player), all integrated into the graphical user interface.
 
  The Handset UX is based on
  
   Qt
  
  , with
  
   GTK+
  
  and
  
   Clutter
  
  included to provide compatibility for Moblin applications.
  

    [22]
   

  To support the hundreds of
  
   Hildon
  
  -based Maemo applications, users have to install the
  
   Hildon
  
  library ported by the maemo.org community. Depending on the device, applications will be provided from either the Intel
  
   AppUp
  
  or the Nokia
  
   Ovi
  

   digital software distribution
  
  systems.
  

    [25]
   


  The MeeGo Handset UX’s "Day 1" prerelease was on 30 June 2010. The preview was initially available for the Aava Mobile Intel Moorestown platform, and a ‘kickstart’ file provided for developers to build an image for the
  
   Nokia N900
  
  .
  

    [26]
   



    [27]
   


  MeeGo OS v1.2 "Harmattan" is used in
  
   Nokia N9
  
  and
  
   N950
  
  phones.
 
  Intel demonstrated the Tablet UX on a
  
   Moorestown-based
  

   tablet PC
  
  at
  
   COMPUTEX Taipei
  
  in early June 2010.
 
  Since then, some information appeared on MeeGo website indicating there will be a Tablet UX part of the MeeGo project, but it is not known if this UX will be the one demonstrated by Intel. This Tablet UX will be fully free like the rest of the MeeGo project and will be coded with Qt and the MeeGo Touch Framework.
  

    [28]
   

  Intel has revealed interest in combining Qt with
  
   Wayland
  
  instead of
  
   X11
  
  in MeeGo Touch in order to utilize the latest graphics technologies supported by
  
   Linux kernel
  
  , which should improve user experiences and reduce system complexity.
  

    [29]
   



    [30]
   


  Minimum hardware requirements are currently unknown.
 
  The
  
   WeTab
  
  runs MeeGo T01 with a custom user interface and was made available in September 2010.
  

    [31]
   


  The
  
   GENIVI Alliance
  
  , a consortium of several car makers and their industry partners, uses Moblin with Qt as base for its 'GENIVI 1.0 Reference Platform' for
  
   In-Vehicle Infotainment
  
  (IVI) and
  
   automotive navigation system
  
  as a uniformed
  
   mobile computing
  
  platform. Graham Smethurst of GENIVI Alliance and BMW Group announced in April 2010 the switch from Moblin to MeeGo.
  

    [32]
   



    [33]
   


  Intel planned to develop a version of MeeGo for IPTV set top boxes, but had since cancelled.
  

    [34]
   


  The MeeGo framework consists of a wide variety of original and upstream components, all of which are licensed under licenses certified by the
  
   Free Initiative
  
  (such as the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  ). In order to allow hardware vendors to personalize their device's user experiences, the project's license policy requires that MeeGo's reference User Experience subsystems be licensed under a
  
   Permissive free software license
  
  – except for libraries that extend MeeGo API's (which were licensed under the
  
   GNU Lesser General Public License
  
  to help discourage fragmentation), or applications (which can be licensed separately).
  

    [35]
   


  The MeeGo Core integrates elements of two other Linux distributions: Maemo (a distribution which Nokia derived from
  
   Debian
  
  ) and Moblin (which Intel derived from
  
   Fedora
  
  ).
  

    [36]
   


  MeeGo uses
  
   RPM
  

   software repositories
  
  . It is one of the first Linux distributions to deploy
  
   Btrfs
  
  as the default
  
   file system
  
  .
 
  Although most of the software in MeeGo's Jolla interface use the
  
   Qt
  

   widget toolkit
  
  , it also supports
  
   GTK
  
  .
  

    [37]
   

  The final revision of MeeGo Qt v4.7, Qt Mobility v1.0, OpenGL ES v2.0.
  

    [38]
   

  MeeGo also supports the
  
   Accounts & SSO
  
  ,
  
   Maliit
  
  ,
  
   oFono
  

   software frameworks
  
  .
 
  MeeGo
  
   compiles
  
  software with the
  
   openSUSE Build Service
  
  .
  

    [39]
   


  As with Moblin before, MeeGo also serves as a technology pool from which software vendors can derive new products.
 
  Even though MeeGo was initiated as collaboration between Nokia and Intel, the collaboration was formed when Nokia was already developing the next incarnation of its Maemo Linux distribution. As a result, the Maemo 6 base operating system was kept intact while the Handset UX was shared, with the name changed to "MeeGo/Harmattan".
  

    [7]
   


  On 21 June 2011, Nokia announced its first MeeGo/Harmattan smartphone device,
  
   Nokia N9
  
  .
  

    [40]
   


  The original
  
   Mer
  
  project was a free re-implementation of Maemo, ported to the Nokia Internet Tablet N800. When MeeGo first appeared this work was discontinued and the development effort went to MeeGo.
 
  After both Nokia and then Intel abandoned MeeGo, the Mer project was revived and continued to develop the MeeGo codebase and tools. It is now being developed in the open by a meritocratic community. Mer provides a Core capable of running various UXs developed by various other projects, and will include maintained application development APIs, such as Qt, EFL, and HTML5/WAC.
 
  Some of the former MeeGo
  
   user interface
  
  were already ported to run on top of Mer, such as the handset reference UX, now called
  
   Nemo Mobile
  
  . There are also a couple of new tablet UXes available, such as
  
   Cordia
  
  and
  
   Plasma Active
  
  . Mer is considered to be the legitimate successor of Meego, as the other follow-up project Tizen (see below) changed the APIs fundamentally.
 

   Nemo Mobile
  
  is a community driven
  
   operating system
  
  incorporating
  
   Mer
  
  targeted at mobile phones and tablet.
 

   Sailfish OS
  
  is an operating system developed by the Finnish startup
  
   Jolla
  
  . It also incorporates
  
   Mer
  
  . After Nokia abandoned their participation in the MeeGo project, the directors and core professionals from Nokia's N9 team left the company and together formed
  
   Jolla
  
  , to bring MeeGo back into the market mainstream. This effort eventually resulted in the creation of the
  
   Sailfish OS
  
  . The Sailfish OS and the
  
   Sailfish OS SDK
  
  are based on the core and the tools of the Mer core distribution,
  

    [41]
   

  which is a revival of the core of the MeeGo project
  

    [42]
   

  (a
  
   meritocracy
  
  -governed and managed successor of the MeeGo OS, but without its own Graphical User Interface and system
  
   kernel
  
  ). Sailfish includes a multi-tasking user interface that Jolla intends to use to differentiate its smartphones from others and as a competitive advantage against devices that run Google's
  
   Android
  
  or Apple's
  
   iOS
  
  .
  

    [43]
   

  Among other things, the Sailfish OS is characterised by:
 
  Although
  
   Tizen
  
  was initially announced as a continuation of the MeeGo effort, there is little shared effort and architecture between these projects, since Tizen inherited much more from Samsung's
  
   LiMo
  
  than from MeeGo. As most of the Tizen work is happening behind closed doors and is done by Intel and Samsung engineers, the people involved in the former MeeGo open source project continued their work under
  
   Mer
  
  and projects associated with it. Because Tizen does not use the
  
   Qt framework
  
  ,
  

    [44]
   

  which is the core part of Meego's API (see above), Tizen cannot technically be considered to be a derivate of MeeGo.
 
  On 1 June 2010, Novell announced that they would ship a
  
   SUSE Linux incarnation
  
  with MeeGo’s Netbook UX (MeeGo User Experience) graphical user interface.
  

    [45]
   


  A MeeGo-based Linux distribution with this user interface is already available from
  
   openSUSE
  
  's Goblin Team under the name
  
   Smeegol Linux
  
  , this project combines MeeGo with openSUSE to get a new netbook-designed Linux distribution. What makes
  
   Smeegol Linux
  
  unique when compared to the upstream MeeGo or openSUSE is that this distribution is at its core based on openSUSE but has the MeeGo User Experience as well as a few other changes such as adding the
  
   Mono
  
  -based
  
   Banshee media player
  
  ,
  
   NetworkManager
  
  -powered network configuration, a newer version of
  
   Evolution Express
  
  , and more. Any end-users can also build their own customized
  
   Smeegol Linux
  
  OS using
  
   SUSE Studio
  
  .

  The latest version of the
  
   instant-on
  
  OS
  
   Splashtop
  
  -platform (by
  
   Splashtop Inc.
  
  which was previously named DeviceVM Inc.) is compliant with MeeGo, and future version of Splashtop will be based on MeeGo and will be available for commercial use in the first half of 2011.
  

    [50]
   



    [51]
   


  It was announced at the Intel Developer Forum 2010 that MeeGo would follow a six-month release schedule. Version 1.0 for Atom netbooks and a code drop for the Nokia N900 became available for download as of Wednesday, 26 May 2010

   Project planning
  

  In February 2011, Nokia announced a partnership with
  
   Microsoft
  
  for mobile handsets
  

    [69]
   

  and the departure of Nokia's MeeGo team manager Alberto Torres,
  

    [70]
   

  leading to speculation as to Nokia's future participation in MeeGo development or using Windows Phone by Nokia.
 
  In September 2011, Nokia began shipping the first MeeGo smartphone
  
   Nokia N9
  
  , ahead of the Windows Phone 7 launch expected later this year.
  

    [71]
   



    [72]
   

  The first MeeGo-based tablet
  
   WeTab
  
  was launched in 2010 by
  
   Neofonie
  
  .
 
  In early July 2012, Nokia's Meego development lead Sotiris Makyrgiannis and other team members left Nokia.
