   Gmail
  
  is a free,
  
   advertising
  
  -supported
  
   email
  
  service developed by
  
   Google
  
  . Users can access Gmail on the web and through the mobile apps for
  
   Android
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  , as well as through third-party programs that synchronize email content through
  
   POP
  
  or
  
   IMAP
  
  protocols. Gmail started as a limited
  
   beta release
  
  on April 1, 2004. It exited beta status on July 7, 2009.
 
  Gmail at launch had an initial storage capacity offer of 1
  
   gigabyte
  
  per user, a significantly higher number than the 2
  
   megabytes
  
  of storage its competitors such as
  
   Hotmail
  
  offered at that time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of free storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from
  
   Google Drive
  
  into the message.
 
  Gmail has a
  
   search
  
  -oriented interface and a
  
   "conversation view"
  
  similar to an
  
   Internet forum
  
  . Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of
  
   Ajax
  
  .
 
  Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails, and to filter spam and malware. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about this practice, with some of the concerns including that the automated background scanning of emails raises the risk that the
  
   expectation of privacy
  
  in email usage will be reduced or eroded; information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users; emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google's privacy policy or terms of service; governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications; and at any time, Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services. Google has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues, both from Gmail users and from non-Gmail users.
 
  Google has stated that "all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing [...] Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery." Google also claims that Gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those that mention race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements.
 
  As of February 2016, Gmail has one billion active users worldwide, and was the first app on the
  
   Google Play Store
  
  to hit one billion installations on
  
   Android
  
  devices. According to a 2014 estimate, 60% of mid-sized US companies, and 92% of
  
   startups
  
  , were using Gmail.
 


  On April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with 1
  
   gigabyte
  
  of storage space,
  

    [3]
   

  a significantly higher number than the 2
  
   megabytes
  
  of storage that
  
   Hotmail
  
  offered at the time.
  

    [4]
   


  On April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail, the limit was doubled to 2 gigabytes of storage. Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would "keep giving people more space forever."
  

    [5]
   


  On April 24, 2012, Google announced the increase of free storage in Gmail from 7.5 to 10 gigabytes ("and counting") as part of the launch of
  
   Google Drive
  
  .
  

    [6]
   


  On May 13, 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 gigabytes of free storage among the three services.
  

    [7]
   



    [8]
   


  Users can buy additional storage, shared among Gmail,
  
   Google Drive
  
  and
  
   Google Photos
  
  , through a monthly subscription plan. As of 2017, storage of up to 15 gigabytes is free, and paid plans are available for up to 30
  
   terabytes
  
  for personal use.
  

    [9]
   


  There are also storage limits to individual Gmail messages. One message, including all attachments, cannot be larger than 25
  
   megabytes
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  This was changed in March 2017, to allow receiving of email up to 50 megabytes, with the limit for sending email staying at 25 megabytes.
  

    [11]
   



    [12]
   

  In order to send larger files, users can insert files from
  
   Google Drive
  
  into the message.
  

    [13]
   


  The Gmail
  
   user interface
  
  initially differed from other webmail systems with its focus on
  
   search
  
  and
  
   conversation threading
  
  of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors. Gmail's user interface designer,
  
   Kevin Fox
  
  , intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.
  

    [14]
   


  Gmail's interface also makes use of 'labels' (tags) – that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible method of organizing email; filters for automatically organizing, deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses; and importance markers for automatically marking messages as 'important'.
 
  In May 2013, Google updated the Gmail inbox with tabs which allow the application to categorize the user's emails. The five tabs are: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. In addition to customization options, the entire update can be disabled, allowing users to return to the traditional inbox structure.
  

    [15]
   



    [16]
   


  In November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that "simplified" the look of Gmail into a more
  
   minimalist
  
  design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall Google design change. Major redesigned elements included a streamlined conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality themes, a resizable navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and better search.
  

    [17]
   



    [18]
   

  Users were able to preview the new interface design for months prior to the official release, as well as revert to the old interface, until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed the transition to the new design for all users.
  

    [19]
   


  Gmail's
  
   spam filtering
  
  features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as
  
   spam
  
  , this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.
  

    [20]
   


  The Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity.
  

    [21]
   


  Popular features, like the "Undo Send" option, often "graduate" from Gmail Labs to become a formal setting in Gmail.
  

    [22]
   


  All Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.
  

    [23]
   


  Gmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails. The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in
  
   Google Drive
  
  , events from
  
   Google Calendar
  
  , and
  
   Google Sites
  
  .
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   



    [26]
   


  In May 2012, Gmail improved the search functionality to include auto-complete predictions from the user's emails.
  

    [27]
   


  Gmail's search functionality does not support searching for word fragments (also known as 'substring search' or partial word search). Workarounds exist.
  

    [28]
   


  In August 2011, Google introduced Gmail Offline, an
  
   HTML5
  
  -powered app for providing access to the service while offline. Gmail Offline runs on the
  
   Google Chrome
  
  browser and can be downloaded from the
  
   Chrome Web Store
  
  .
  

    [29]
   



    [30]
   



    [31]
   


  In August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's
  
   Google Chat
  
  interface. The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both "Google Voice in Gmail chat" and "Call Phones in Gmail".
  

    [32]
   



    [33]
   



    [34]
   

  The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours.
  

    [34]
   



    [35]
   


  In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from
  
   Google Hangouts
  
  , another communication platform from Google.
  

    [36]
   



    [37]
   


  As of March 2015, the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including:
  
   Arabic

  In October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards,
  
   transliterations
  
  , and
  
   input method editors
  
  to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that aren't "limited by the language of your keyboard.”
  

    [39]
   



    [40]
   


  In October 2013, Google added handwriting input support to Gmail.
  

    [41]
   


  In August 2014, Gmail became the first major email provider to let users send and receive email from addresses with accent marks and letters from outside the
  
   Latin alphabet
  
  .
  

    [42]
   



    [43]
   


  In May 2013, Google announced the integration between
  
   Google Wallet
  
  and Gmail, which would allow Gmail users to send money as email attachments. Although the sender must use a Gmail account, the recipient does not need to be using a Gmail address.
  

    [44]
   



    [45]
   

  The feature has no transaction fees, but there are limits to amount of money that can be sent.
  

    [46]
   

  Initially only available on the web, the feature was expanded to the Android app in March 2017, for people living in the United States.
  

    [47]
   



    [48]
   


  Gmail's "basic HTML" version will work on almost all browsers. The modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of
  
   Google Chrome
  
  ,
  
   Mozilla Firefox
  
  ,
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft Edge
  
  and
  
   Safari
  
  web browsers on a rolling basis.
  

    [49]
   



    [50]
   


  In addition to the native apps on iOS and Android, users can access Gmail through the web browser on a mobile device.
  

    [51]
   


  Gmail has native applications for
  
   iOS
  
  devices
  

    [52]
   

  (including
  
   iPhone
  
  ,
  
   iPad
  
  , and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  ) and for
  
   Android
  
  devices.
  

    [53]
   


  In November 2014, Google introduced functionality in the Gmail Android app that enabled sending and receiving email from non-Gmail addresses (such as
  
   Yahoo! Mail
  
  and
  
   Outlook.com
  
  ) through POP or IMAP.
  

    [54]
   


  In November 2016, Google redesigned the Gmail app for the iOS platform, bringing the first complete visual overhaul in "nearly four years". The update added much more use of colors, sleeker transitions, and the addition of several "highly-requested" features, including Undo Send, faster search with instant results and spelling suggestions, and Swipe to Archive/Delete.
  

    [55]
   



    [56]
   


  Inbox by Gmail, another app from the Gmail team, is also available for iOS
  

    [57]
   

  and Android
  

    [58]
   

  devices.
 
  Third-party programs can be used to access Gmail, using the
  
   POP
  
  or
  
   IMAP
  
  protocols.
  

    [59]
   


  In October 2014, Google introduced
  
   Inbox by Gmail
  
  on an invitation-only basis. Developed by the Gmail team, but serving as a "completely different type of inbox", the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email. Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times.
  

    [60]
   



    [61]
   



    [62]
   


  Inbox by Gmail became publicly available in May 2015.
  

    [63]
   


  In September 2016, Google released
  
   Google Trips
  
  , an app that, based on information from a user's Gmail messages, automatically generates travel cards. A travel card contains itinerary details, such as plane tickets and car rentals, and recommends activities, food and drinks, and attractions based on location, time, and interests. The app also has offline functionality.
  

    [64]
   



    [65]
   


  Google has supported secure
  
   HTTPS
  
  since the day it launched. In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made "your mail slower". However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in. In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu.
  

    [66]
   


  In 2007, Google fixed a
  
   cross-site scripting
  
  security issue that could let attackers collect information from Gmail contact lists.
  

    [67]
   


  In January 2010, Google began rolling out HTTPS as the default for all users.
  

    [68]
   


  In June 2012, a new security feature was introduced to protect users from state-sponsored attacks. A banner will appear at the top of the page that warns users of an unauthorized account compromise.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   


  In March 2014, Google announced that an encrypted HTTPS connection will be used for the sending and receiving of all Gmail emails, and "every single email message you send or receive —100% of them —is encrypted while moving internally" through the company's systems.
  

    [71]
   


  Whenever possible, Gmail uses
  
   transport layer security
  
  (TLS) to automatically encrypt emails sent and received. On the web and on Android devices, users can check if a message is encrypted by checking if the message has a closed or open red padlock.
  

    [72]
   


  Gmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for viruses in email attachments. For security reasons, some file types, including executables, are not allowed to be sent in emails.
  

    [73]
   


  In Google's Transparency Report under the Safer email section, it provides information on the percentage of emails encrypted in transit between Gmail and third-party email providers.
  

    [74]
   


  Gmail supports
  
   two-step verification
  
  ; an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in.
  

    [75]
   


  Once enabled, users are required to verify their identity using a second method after entering their username and password when logging in on a new device. Common methods include entering a code sent to a user's mobile phone through a text message, entering a code using the
  
   Google Authenticator
  
  smartphone app, or by inserting a physical security key into the computer's USB port.
  

    [76]
   


  Using a security key for two-step verification was made available as an option in October 2014.
  

    [77]
   



    [78]
   


  If an algorithm detects what Google calls "abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised", the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include:
  

    [79]
   


  Google combats child pornography through Gmail's servers in conjunction with the
  
   National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
  
  (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world. In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures. Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a
  
   hash
  
  . Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes. When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the authorities.
  

    [80]
   


  The idea for Gmail was developed by
  
   Paul Buchheit
  
  several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name
  
   Caribou
  
  . During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project became better and better, and by early 2004, almost everybody was using it to access the company's internal email system.
  

    [81]
   


  Gmail was announced to the public by Google on April 1, 2004 as a limited
  
   beta release
  
  .
  

    [82]
   


  In November 2006, Google began offering a
  
   Java
  
  -based application of Gmail for mobile phones.
  

    [83]
   


  In October 2007, Google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that Gmail used, which would make the service faster and add new features, such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to bookmark specific messages and email searches.
  

    [84]
   

  Gmail also added IMAP support in October 2007.
  

    [85]
   


  An update around January 2008 changed elements of Gmail's use of
  
   JavaScript
  
  , and resulted in the failure of a third-party script some users had been using. Google acknowledge the issue and helped users with workarounds.
  

    [86]
   


  Gmail exited the beta status on July 7, 2009.
  

    [87]
   


  Prior to December 2013, users had to approve to see images in emails, which acted as a security measure. This changed in December 2013, when Google, citing improved image handling, enabled images to be visible without user approval. Images will be routed through Google's secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers.
  

    [88]
   


   MarketingLand
  
  noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipient's
  
   IP address
  
  or information about what kind of device the recipient is using.
  

    [89]
   

  However,
  

    Wired
   

  stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened, as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a "callback" to the original server.
  

    [90]
   


  In June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally.
  

    [91]
   


  In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices.
  

    [92]
   


  In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion active users.
  

    [93]
   



    [94]
   


  In the business sector,
  

    Quartz
   

  reported in August 2014 that, among 150 companies checked in three major categories in the United States (
  
   Fortune 50
  
  largest companies, mid-size tech and media companies, and
  
   startup companies
  
  from the last
  
   Y Combinator
  
  incubator class), only one Fortune 50 company used Gmail - Google itself - while 60% of mid-sized companies and 92% of startup companies were using Gmail.
  

    [95]
   


  In May 2014, Gmail became the first app on the
  
   Google Play Store
  
  to hit one billion installations on
  
   Android
  
  devices.
  

    [96]
   


  On February 9, 2010, Google commenced its new social networking tool,
  
   Google Buzz
  
  , which integrated with Gmail, allowing users to share links and media, as well as status updates.
  

    [97]
   


  Google Buzz was discontinued in October 2011, replaced with new functionality in
  
   Google+
  
  , Google's then-new social networking platform.
  

    [98]
   



    [99]
   


  Gmail was integrated with Google+ in December 2011, as part of an effort to have all Google information across one Google account, with a centralized Google+ user profile.
  

    [100]
   

  Backlash from the move caused Google to step back and remove the requirement of a Google+ user account, keeping only a private Google account without a public-facing profile, starting in July 2015.
  

    [101]
   


  In August 2006, Google announced Google Apps for Your Domain; special Google accounts with access to several of Google's services, with additional admin tools and custom email addresses, targeted at organizations, small businesses, large enterprises, educational institutions, and
  
   ISPs
  
  . The project was an expansion of the Gmail for Your Domain service launched in February 2006.
  

    [102]
   


  The service has gone through several rebrandings, eventually being currently branded G Suite. G Suite includes access to popular Google services, including Gmail, with additional advanced functionality, and more privacy, specifically developed for different types of organizations and businesses.

  Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of
  
   Ajax
  
  .
  

    [107]
   


  Gmail was ranked second in
  

    PC World
   
   '
  
  s "100 Best Products of 2005", behind
  
   Mozilla Firefox
  
  . Gmail also won 'Honorable Mention' in the Bottom Line Design Awards 2005.
  

    [108]
   



    [109]
   

  In September 2006,
  
   Forbes magazine
  
  declared Gmail to be the best
  
   webmail
  
  application for small businesses.
  

    [110]
   

  In November 2006, Gmail received PC World's 4 star rating.
  

    [111]
   


  Google has one privacy policy that cover all of its services.
  

    [112]
   


  Google claims that Gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those that mention race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements.
  

    [113]
   


  Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails, and to filter spam and malware.

  Privacy advocates raised concerns about this practice; concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine (as opposed to a person) can allow Google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever; the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the
  
   expectation of privacy
  
  in email usage will be reduced or eroded; information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users; emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google's privacy policy or terms of service; Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally, and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users; in court cases, governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications; at any time, Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services; and any internal security problem on Google's systems can potentially expose many - or all - of its users.

  In 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third-party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.

  In March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users' privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads.

  In July 2012, some California residents filed two class action lawsuits against Google and
  
   Yahoo!
  
  , claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non-Gmail or non-Yahoo! email users to Gmail and Yahoo! recipients without the senders' knowledge, consent or permission.
  

    [120]
   

  A motion filed by Google's attorneys in the case concedes that Gmail users have "no expectation of privacy".

  A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no "reasonable expectation" exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails.

  In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained:
 
   "... all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing ... Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery.

  A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013 that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users "very seriously."

  Google updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content. The relevant revision states: "Our automated systems analyse your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customised search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored." A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies "to be simple and easy for users to understand."
 
  In response to the update, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, stated: "The really dangerous things that Google is doing are things like the information held in Analytics, cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts".

  In 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy "Google's kryptonite." In response, Google stated; "We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant ... No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information. An automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown.”
  

    The New York Times
   

  cites "Google supporters", who say that "Microsoft’s ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products".

  In January 2010, Google detected a "highly sophisticated" cyber-attack on its infrastructure that originated from China. The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been "routinely accessed by third parties". Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that "at least" 20 other large companies from a "wide range of businesses" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors - had been similarly targeted. Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it was also working with relevant US authorities. In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails.

  The February 2010 launch of
  
   Google Buzz
  
  , a former social network that was linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users' contacts unless the default settings were changed.

  A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users can email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient. Marc Rotenberg, President of the
  
   Electronic Privacy Information Center
  
  , called the feature "troubling", and compared it to the Google Buzz initial launch privacy flaw.

  In June 2016, Julia Angwin of
  
   ProPublica
  
  wrote about Google's updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with
  
   personally identifiable information
  
  from its other services. This change has allowed Google to merge users’ personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user. After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting.

  Gmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009 alone, causing doubts about the reliability of its service.

    [131]
   

  It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to be empty. Google stated in a blog post that "email was never lost" and restoration was in progress.
  

    [132]
   

  Another outage occurred on April 17, 2012,
  

    [133]
   

  September 24, 2013,
  

    [134]
   

  and January 24, 2014.

  Google has stated that "Gmail remains more than 99.9% available to all users, and we're committed to keeping events like today's notable for their rarity."

  In May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on
  

    The New York Times
   

  blog about Gmail's "on behalf of" tag. Manjoo explained: "The problems is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using
  
   Microsoft Outlook
  
  , he'll see a message like, "From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com." Manjoo further wrote that "Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software".
  

    [137]
   

  The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the "On behalf of" tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers.
