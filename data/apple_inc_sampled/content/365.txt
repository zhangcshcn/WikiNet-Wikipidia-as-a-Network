   Windows 8
  
  is a
  
   personal computer
  

   operating system
  
  developed by
  
   Microsoft
  
  as part of the
  
   Windows NT
  
  family of operating systems. Development of Windows 8 started before the release of its predecessor,
  
   Windows 7
  
  , in 2009. It was announced at
  
   CES
  
  2011, and followed by the release of three
  
   pre-release
  
  versions from September 2011 to May 2012. The operating system was
  
   released to manufacturing
  
  on August 1, 2012, and was released for
  
   general availability
  
  on October 26, 2012.
  

    [5]
   


  Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and
  
   user interface
  
  to improve its user experience on
  
   tablets
  
  , where Windows was now competing with
  
   mobile operating systems
  
  , including
  
   Android
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized
  
   Windows shell
  
  based on Microsoft's
  
   "Metro"
  

   design language
  
  , the
  
   Start screen
  
  (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing "
  
   apps
  
  " with an emphasis on
  
   touchscreen
  
  input, integration with online services (including the ability to synchronize apps and settings between devices), and
  
   Windows Store
  
  , an online store for downloading and purchasing new software. Windows 8 added support for
  
   USB 3.0
  
  ,
  
   Advanced Format
  
  hard drives,
  
   near field communications
  
  , and
  
   cloud computing
  
  . Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in
  
   antivirus software
  
  , integration with
  
   Microsoft SmartScreen
  

   phishing filtering
  
  service and support for
  
   UEFI Secure Boot
  
  on supported devices with
  
   UEFI firmware
  
  , to prevent
  
   malware
  
  from infecting the boot process.
 
  Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception. Although reaction towards its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million Windows 8 licenses were sold through January 2013, a number that included both upgrades and sales to
  
   OEMs
  
  for new PCs.
  

    [7]
   


  On October 17, 2013, Microsoft released
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  . It addressed some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and
  
   early adopters
  
  and incorporated additional improvements to various aspects of the operating system.
  

    [8]
   



    [9]
   

  Windows 8 was ultimately succeeded by
  
   Windows 10
  
  in July 2015. Support for Windows 8 RTM ended on January 12, 2016; per Microsoft lifecycle policies regarding
  
   service packs
  
  , Windows 8.1 must be installed to maintain support and receive further updates.
  

    [10]
   




  Windows 8 development started before
  
   Windows 7
  
  had shipped in 2009.
  

    [11]
   

  At the
  
   Consumer Electronics Show
  
  in January 2011, it was announced that the next version of Windows would add support for
  
   ARM
  

   system-on-chips
  
  alongside the existing
  
   x86
  
  processors produced by vendors, especially
  
   AMD
  
  and
  
   Intel
  
  . Windows division president
  
   Steven Sinofsky
  
  demonstrated an early build of the port on prototype devices, while Microsoft CEO
  
   Steve Ballmer
  
  announced the company's goal for Windows to be "everywhere on every kind of device without compromise."
  

    [12]
   



    [13]
   



    [14]
   



    [15]
   

  Details also began to surface about a new application framework for Windows 8 codenamed "Jupiter", which would be used to make "immersive" applications using
  
   XAML
  
  (similarly to
  
   Windows Phone
  
  and
  
   Silverlight
  
  ) that could be distributed via a new packaging system and a rumored
  
   application store
  
  .
  

    [16]
   


  Three
  
   milestone releases
  
  of Windows 8
  
   leaked
  
  to the general public. Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011.
  

    [17]
   

  It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text
  
   shhh... let's not leak our hard work
  
  . However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010.
  

    [18]
   

  The leaked copy was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as "Windows 7". Milestone 2, Build 7955, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The traditional
  
   Blue Screen of Death
  
  (BSoD) was replaced by a new
  
   black
  
  screen, although this was later scrapped.
  

    [19]
   

  This build introduced a new
  
   ribbon
  
  in Windows Explorer. Build 7959, with minor changes but the first 64-bit version, was leaked on May 1, 2011. The "Windows 7" logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying "Microsoft Confidential". On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later scrapped, and the circling dots as featured in the final (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber). It also had the text
  
   Welcome
  
  below them, although this was also scrapped.
  

    [20]
   


  On June 1, 2011, Microsoft unveiled Windows 8's new user interface, as well as additional features at both
  
   Computex Taipei
  
  and the
  
   D9: All Things Digital
  
  conference in California.
  

    [21]
   



    [22]
   


  The "Building Windows 8" blog launched on August 15, 2011, featuring details surrounding Windows 8's features and its development process.
  

    [23]
   


  Microsoft unveiled more Windows 8 features and improvements on the first day of the
  
   Build conference
  
  on September 13, 2011.
  

    [24]
   

  Microsoft released the first public beta build of Windows 8, Windows Developer Preview (build 8102) at the event. A
  
   Samsung
  
  tablet running the build was also distributed to conference attendees.
 
  The build was released for download later in the day in standard 32-bit and 64-bit versions, plus a special 64-bit version which included SDKs and developer tools (
  
   Visual Studio Express
  
  and
  
   Expression Blend
  
  ) for developing Metro-style apps.
  

    [25]
   

  The Windows Store was announced during the presentation, but was not available in this build.
  

    [26]
   



    [27]
   

  According to Microsoft, there were about 535,000 downloads of the developer preview within the first 12 hours of its release.
  

    [28]
   

  Originally set to expire on March 11, 2012, in February 2012 the Developer Preview's expiry date was changed to January 15, 2013.
  

    [29]
   


  On February 19, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new logo to be adopted for Windows 8. Designed by
  
   Pentagram
  
  partner
  
   Paula Scher
  
  , the Windows logo was changed to resemble a set of four window panes. Additionally, the entire logo is now rendered in a single solid color.
  

    [30]
   


  On February 29, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 Consumer Preview, the beta version of Windows 8, build 8250. Alongside other changes, the build removed the
  
   Start button
  
  from the taskbar for the first time since its debut on
  
   Windows 95
  
  ; according to Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen, the Start button was removed to reflect their view that on Windows 8, the desktop was an "app" itself, and not the primary interface of the operating system.
  

    [31]
   



    [32]
   

  Windows president Steven Sinofsky said more than 100,000 changes had been made since the developer version went public.
  

    [32]
   

  The day after its release, Windows 8 Consumer Preview had been downloaded over one million times.
  

    [33]
   

  Like the Developer Preview, the Consumer Preview expired on January 15, 2013.
 
  Many other builds were released until the Japan's Developers Day conference, when Steven Sinofsky announced that Windows 8 Release Preview (build 8400) would be released during the first week of June.
  

    [34]
   

  On May 28, 2012, Windows 8 Release Preview (Standard Simplified Chinese x64 edition, not China-specific version, build 8400) was leaked online on various Chinese and BitTorrent websites.
  

    [35]
   

  On May 31, 2012, Windows 8 Release Preview was released to the public by Microsoft.
  

    [36]
   

  Major items in the Release Preview included the addition of Sports, Travel, and News apps, along with an integrated version of
  
   Adobe Flash Player
  
  in
  
   Internet Explorer
  
  .
  

    [37]
   

  Like the Developer Preview and the Consumer Preview, the release preview expired on January 15, 2013.
 
  On August 1, 2012, Windows 8 (build 9200
  

    [38]
   

  ) was
  
   released to manufacturing
  
  with the build number 6.2.9200.16384 .
  

    [39]
   

  Microsoft planned to hold a launch event on October 25, 2012
  

    [40]
   

  and release Windows 8 for
  
   general availability
  
  on the next day.
  

    [41]
   

  However, only a day after its release to manufacturing, a copy of the final version of Windows 8 Enterprise N (a version for European markets which lacks bundled media players to comply with an
  
   antitrust ruling
  
  ) leaked online, followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise a few days later.
  

    [42]
   



    [43]
   

  On August 15, 2012, Windows 8 was made available to download for
  
   MSDN
  
  and
  
   TechNet
  
  subscribers.
  

    [44]
   

  Windows 8 was made available to Software Assurance customers on August 16, 2012.
  

    [45]
   

  Windows 8 was made available for students with a
  
   DreamSpark Premium
  
  subscription on August 22, 2012, earlier than advertised.
  

    [46]
   


  Relatively few changes were made from the Release Preview to the final version; these included updated versions of its pre-loaded apps, the renaming of Windows Explorer to File Explorer, the replacement of the Aero Glass theme from Windows Vista and 7 with a new flat and solid-colored theme, and the addition of new background options for the Start screen, lock screen, and desktop.
  

    [47]
   

  Prior to its general availability on October 26, 2012, updates were released for some of Windows 8's bundled apps, and a "General Availability Cumulative Update" (which included fixes to improve performance, compatibility, and battery life) was
  
   released on Tuesday
  
  , October 9, 2012. Microsoft indicated that due to improvements to its testing infrastructure, general improvements of this nature are to be released more frequently through Windows Update instead of being relegated to
  
   OEMs
  
  and
  
   service packs
  
  only.
  

    [48]
   



    [49]
   


  Microsoft began an advertising campaign centered around Windows 8 and its
  
   Surface
  
  tablet in October 2012, starting with its first television advertisement premiering on October 14, 2012.
  

    [6]
   

  Microsoft's advertising budget of US$1.5–1.8 billion was significantly larger than the US$200 million campaign used to promote
  
   Windows 95
  
  .
  

    [50]
   

  As part of its campaign, Microsoft set up 34
  
   pop-up stores
  
  inside malls to showcase the Surface product line, provided training for retail employees in partnership with
  
   Intel
  
  , and collaborated with the electronics store chain
  
   Best Buy
  
  to design expanded spaces to showcase devices. In an effort to make retail displays of Windows 8 devices more "personal", Microsoft also developed a character known in English-speaking markets as "Allison Brown", whose fictional profile (including personal photos, contacts, and emails) is also featured on demonstration units of Windows 8 devices.
  

    [51]
   


  In May 2013, Microsoft launched a new television campaign for Windows 8 illustrating the capabilities and pricing of Windows 8 tablets in comparison to the
  
   iPad
  
  , which featured the voice of
  
   Siri
  
  remarking on the iPad's limitations in a parody of Apple's "
  
   Get a Mac
  
  " advertisements.
  

    [52]
   



    [53]
   

  On June 12, 2013 during game 1 of the
  
   2013 Stanley Cup Finals
  
  , Microsoft premiered the first ad in its "Windows Everywhere" campaign, which promoted Windows 8,
  
   Windows Phone 8
  
  , and the company's suite of online services as an interconnected platform.
  

    [54]
   



    [55]
   


  New features and functionality in Windows 8 include a faster startup through
  
   UEFI
  
  integration and the new "Hybrid Boot" mode (which
  
   hibernates
  
  the Windows
  
   kernel
  
  on shutdown to speed up the subsequent boot),
  

    [56]
   

  a new lock screen with a clock and notifications,
  

    [57]
   

  and the ability for enterprise users to create
  
   live USB
  
  versions of Windows (known as
  
   Windows To Go
  
  ).
  

    [58]
   



    [59]
   

  Windows 8 also adds native support for
  
   USB 3.0
  
  devices, which allow for faster data transfers and improved power management with compatible devices,
  

    [60]
   



    [61]
   

  and
  
   hard disk
  
  4KB
  
   Advanced Format
  
  support,
  

    [62]
   

  as well as support for
  
   near field communication
  
  to facilitate sharing and communication between devices.
  

    [63]
   



   Windows Explorer
  
  , which has been renamed File Explorer, now includes a
  
   ribbon
  
  in place of the command bar. File operation dialog boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics, the ability to pause file transfers, and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when copying files.
  

    [64]
   

  A new "File History" function allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device,
  

    [65]
   

  while
  
   Storage Spaces
  
  allows users to combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify mirroring, parity, or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis.
  

    [66]
   

  For easier management of files and folders, Windows 8 introduces the ability to move selected files or folders via
  
   drag and drop
  
  from a parent folder into a subfolder listed within the
  
   breadcrumb
  
  hierarchy of the
  
   address bar
  
  in File Explorer.
  

    [67]
   



   Task Manager
  
  has been redesigned, including a new processes tab with the option to display fewer or more details of running applications and background processes, a heat map using different colors indicating the level of resource usage, network and disk counters, grouping by process type (e.g. applications, background processes and Windows processes), friendly names for processes and a new option which allows users to search the web to find information about obscure processes.
  

    [68]
   

  Additionally, the
  
   Blue Screen of Death
  
  has been updated with a simpler and modern design with less technical information displayed.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   


  New security features in Windows 8 include two new authentication methods tailored towards touchscreens (
  
   PINs
  
  and picture passwords),
  

    [71]
   

  the addition of
  
   antivirus
  
  capabilities to
  
   Windows Defender
  
  (bringing it in parity with
  
   Microsoft Security Essentials
  
  ).
  

    [72]
   


   SmartScreen
  
  filtering integrated into Windows,
  

    [73]
   


   Family Safety
  
  offers
  
   Parental controls
  
  , which allows parents to monitor and manage their children's activities on a device with activity reports and safety controls.
  

    [74]
   



    [75]
   



    [76]
   

  Windows 8 also provides integrated
  
   system recovery
  
  through the new "Refresh" and "Reset" functions,
  

    [77]
   

  including system recovery from USB drive.
  

    [78]
   

  Windows 8's first security patches would be released on November 13, 2012; it would contain three fixes deemed "critical" by the company.
  

    [79]
   


  Windows 8 supports a feature of the
  
   UEFI
  
  specification known as "Secure boot", which uses a
  
   public-key infrastructure
  
  to verify the integrity of the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs such as
  
   bootkits
  
  from infecting the device's boot process.
  

    [80]
   

  Some pre-built devices may be described as "certified" by Microsoft; these must have secure boot enabled by default, and provide ways for users to disable or re-configure the feature.
  
   ARM
  
  -based
  
   Windows RT
  
  devices must have secure boot permanently enabled.
  

    [81]
   



    [82]
   



    [83]
   


  Windows 8 provides heavier integration with online services from Microsoft and others. A user can now log into Windows with a
  
   Microsoft account
  
  , which can be used to access services and
  
   synchronize
  
  applications and settings between devices. Windows 8 also ships with a client app for Microsoft's
  
   SkyDrive
  

   cloud storage
  
  service, which also allows apps to save files directly to SkyDrive. A SkyDrive client for the desktop and
  
   File Explorer
  
  is not included in Windows 8, and must be downloaded separately.
  

    [84]
   

  Bundled multimedia apps are provided under the Xbox brand, including
  
   Xbox Music
  
  ,
  
   Xbox Video
  
  , and the
  
   Xbox SmartGlass
  
  companion for use with an
  
   Xbox 360
  
  console. Games can integrate into an
  
   Xbox Live
  
  hub app, which also allows users to view their profile and
  
   gamerscore
  
  .
  

    [85]
   

  Other bundled apps provide the ability to link
  
   Flickr
  
  and
  
   Facebook
  
  .
  

    [86]
   

  Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.
  

    [87]
   



   Internet Explorer 10
  
  is included as both a desktop program and a touch-optimized app, and includes increased support for
  
   HTML5
  
  ,
  
   CSS3
  
  , and
  
   hardware acceleration
  
  . The Internet Explorer app does not support plugins or
  
   ActiveX
  
  components, but includes a version of
  
   Adobe Flash Player
  
  that is optimized for touch and low power usage. Initially, Adobe Flash would only work on sites included on a "Compatibility View"
  
   whitelist
  
  ; however, after feedback from users and additional compatibility tests, an update in March 2013 changed this behavior to use a smaller
  
   blacklist
  
  of sites with known compatibility issues instead, allowing Flash to be used on most sites by default.
  

    [88]
   

  The desktop version does not contain these limitations.
  

    [89]
   


  Windows 8 also incorporates improved support for
  
   mobile broadband
  
  ; the operating system can now detect the insertion of a
  
   SIM card
  
  and automatically configure connection settings (including
  
   APNs
  
  and carrier branding), and reduce its Internet usage in order to conserve bandwidth on
  
   metered networks
  
  . Windows 8 also adds an integrated
  
   airplane mode
  
  setting to globally disable all wireless connectivity as well. Carriers can also offer account management systems through Windows Store apps, which can be automatically installed as a part of the connection process and offer usage statistics on their respective tile.
  

    [90]
   


  Windows 8 introduces a new style of application,
  

    Windows Store
   
   apps
  
  . According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris, these apps are to be optimized for
  
   touchscreen
  
  environments and are more specialized than current
  
   desktop applications
  
  . Apps can run either in a full-screen mode, or be snapped to the side of a screen.
  

    [91]
   

  Apps can provide
  
   toast notifications
  
  on screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen with dynamic content. Apps can use "contracts"; a collection of
  
   hooks
  
  to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps, including search and sharing.
  

    [91]
   

  Apps can also provide integration with other services; for example, the People app can connect to a variety of different social networks and services (such as Facebook,
  
   Skype
  
  , and
  
   People service
  
  ), while the Photos app can aggregate photos from services such as Facebook and Flickr.
  

    [86]
   


  Windows Store apps run within a new set of
  
   APIs
  
  known as
  
   Windows Runtime
  
  , which supports
  
   programming languages
  
  such as
  
   C
  
  ,
  
   C++
  
  ,
  
   Visual Basic .NET
  
  ,
  
   C#
  
  , along with
  
   HTML5
  
  and
  
   JavaScript
  
  .
  

    [91]
   

  If written in some "high-level" languages, apps written for Windows Runtime can be compatible with both Intel and
  
   ARM
  
  versions of Windows,
  

    [92]
   

  otherwise they are not
  
   binary code compatible
  
  . Components may be compiled as Windows Runtime Components, permitting consumption by all compatible languages.
  

    [93]
   

  To ensure stability and security, apps run within a
  
   sandboxed environment
  
  , and require permissions to access certain functionality, such as accessing the Internet or a camera.
  

    [94]
   


  Retail versions of Windows 8 are only able to install these apps through
  
   Windows Store
  
  — a namesake distribution platform that offers both apps, and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with Windows 8.
  

    [92]
   



    [94]
   

  A method to
  
   sideload
  
  apps from outside Windows Store is available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise and joined to a
  
   domain
  
  ; Windows 8 Pro and
  
   Windows RT
  
  devices that are not part of a domain can also sideload apps, but only after special product keys are obtained through volume licensing.
  

    [95]
   


  The term "Immersive app" had been used internally by Microsoft developers to refer to the apps prior to the first official presentation of Windows 8, after which they were referred to as "Metro-style apps" in reference to the
  
   Metro design language
  
  . The term was phased out in August 2012; a Microsoft spokesperson denied rumors that the change was related to a potential trademark issue, and stated that "Metro" was only a codename that would be replaced prior to Windows 8's release.
  

    [16]
   



    [96]
   

  Following these reports, the terms "Modern UI-style apps",
  

    [97]
   

  "Windows 8-style apps"
  

    [98]
   

  and "Windows Store apps" began to be used by various Microsoft documents and material to refer to the new apps. In an interview on September 12, 2012, Soma Somasegar (vice president of Microsoft's development software division) confirmed that "Windows Store apps" would be the official term for the apps.
  

    [99]
   

  An MSDN page explaining the Metro design language uses the term "Modern design" to refer to the language as a whole.
  

    [100]
   


  Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to
  
   web browsers
  
  . The user's default browser can distribute a Metro-style web browser in same package as the desktop version, which has access to functionality unavailable to other apps, such as being able to permanently run in the background, use multiple background processes, and use
  
   Windows API
  
  code instead of WinRT (allowing for code to be re-used with the desktop version, while still taking advantage of features available to Windows Store apps, such as charms). Microsoft advertises this exception privilege "New experience enabled" (formerly "Metro-style enabled").
 
  The developers of both
  
   Chrome
  
  and
  
   Firefox
  
  committed to developing Metro-style versions of their browsers; while Chrome's "Windows 8 mode" (discontinued on Chrome version 49) uses a full-screen version of the existing desktop interface, Firefox's version (which was first made available on the "Aurora" release channel in September 2013) uses a touch-optimized interface inspired by the
  
   Android version of Firefox
  
  . In October 2013, Chrome's app was changed to mimic the desktop environment used by
  
   Chrome OS
  
  .

  Development of the Firefox app for Windows 8 has since been cancelled, citing a lack of user adoption for the beta versions.

  Windows 8 introduces significant changes to the operating system's user interface, many of which are aimed at improving its experience on
  
   tablet computers
  
  and other
  
   touchscreen
  
  devices. The new user interface is based on Microsoft's
  
   Metro design language
  
  , and uses a
  
   Start screen
  
  similar to that of
  
   Windows Phone 7
  
  as the primary means of launching applications. The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles linking to various apps and desktop programs, some of which can display constantly updated information and content through "live tiles".
  

    [91]
   

  As a form of
  
   multi-tasking
  
  , apps can be snapped to the side of a screen.
  

    [91]
   

  Alongside the traditional
  
   Control Panel
  
  , a new simplified and touch-optimized settings app known as "PC Settings" is used for basic configuration and user settings. It does not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the normal Control Panel.
  

    [108]
   


  A vertical
  
   toolbar
  
  known as
  
   the charms
  


    [109]
   

  (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at
  
   hotspots
  
  in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button.
  

    [109]
   



    [110]
   

  The traditional
  
   desktop environment
  
  for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a
  
   hotspot
  
  in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large
  
   tooltip
  
  displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen.
  

    [111]
   



    [112]
   

  Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps.
  

    [112]
   

  Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the
  
   Aero Glass
  
  theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 is similar to that of
  
   Windows 7
  
  .
  

    [113]
   


  Several notable features have been removed in Windows 8; support for playing
  
   DVD-Video
  
  was removed from
  
   Windows Media Player
  
  due to the cost of licensing the necessary decoders (especially for devices which do not include
  
   optical disc drives
  
  at all) and the prevalence of online streaming services. For the same reasons,
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  is not included by default on Windows 8, but Windows Media Center and DVD playback support can be purchased in the "Pro Pack" (which upgrades the system to Windows 8 Pro) or "Media Center Pack" add-on for Windows 8 Pro. As with prior versions, third-party
  
   DVD player
  
  software can still be used to enable DVD playback.
  

    [114]
   



   Backup and Restore
  
  , the
  
   backup component
  
  of Windows, is
  
   deprecated
  
  . It still ships with Windows 8 and continues to work on preset schedules, but is pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a Control Panel applet called "Windows 7 File Recovery".
  

    [115]
   


   :76
  

   Shadow Copy
  
  , a component of
  
   Windows Explorer
  
  that once saved previous versions of changed files, no longer protects local files and folders. It can only access previous versions of shared files stored on a
  
   Windows Server
  
  computer.
  

    [115]
   


   :74
  
  The subsystem on which these components worked, however, is still available for other software to use.
  

    [115]
   


   :74
  

  The minimum system requirements for Windows 8 are slightly higher than
  
   those of Windows 7
  
  . The
  
   CPU
  
  must support the
  
   Physical Address Extension
  
  (PAE),
  
   NX bit
  
  , and
  
   SSE2
  
  . Windows Store apps require a screen resolution of 1024×768 or higher to run; a resolution of 1366×768 or higher is required to use the snap functionality.
  

    [116]
   

  To receive certification, Microsoft requires candidate x86 systems to resume from standby in 2 seconds or less.
  

    [117]
   


  Microsoft's
  
   Connected Standby
  
  specification, which hardware vendors may optionally comply with, sets new power consumption requirements that extend above the above minimum specifications.
  

    [121]
   

  Included in this standard are a number of security-specific requirements designed to improve
  
   physical security
  
  , notably against
  
   Cold Boot Attacks
  
  .
 
  32-bit SKUs of Windows 8 only support a maximum of 4 GB of RAM. 64-bit SKUs, however support more: Windows 8 x64 supports 128 GB while Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise x64 support 512 GB.
  

    [122]
   


  Microsoft will no longer support Windows 8.1 on computers using CPUs that utilize Intel's
  
   Skylake
  
  microarchitecture effective July 17, 2018. All future CPU microarchitectures, as well as Skylake systems after this date, will only be supported on
  
   Windows 10
  
  . After the deadline, only critical security updates will be released for users on these platforms. This will not affect the support status of older CPUs on Windows 8.1.
  

    [123]
   



    [124]
   



    [125]
   



    [126]
   


  Microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and
  
   laplet
  
  devices to be "certified" for Windows 8, and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the PC, display and rechargeable power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis. A convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism.
  

    [127]
   



    [128]
   

  On March 12, 2013, Microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 1024×768 (down from the previous 1366×768). The amended requirement is intended to allow "greater design flexibility" for future products.
  

    [129]
   


     If a mobile broadband device is integrated into a tablet or convertible system, then an
     
      assisted GPS
     
     radio is required. Devices supporting
     
      near field communication
     
     need to have visual marks to help users locate and use the proximity technology. The new button combination for Ctrl + Alt + Del is Windows Key + Power.
    
  Updated certification requirements were implemented to coincide with Windows 8.1. As of 2014, all certified devices with integrated displays must contain a 720p webcam and higher quality speakers and microphones, while all certified devices that support Wi-Fi must support Bluetooth as well. As of 2015, all certified devices must contain
  
   Trusted Platform Module 2.0
  
  chips.
  

    [131]

  Windows 8 is available in three different editions, of which the lowest version, branded simply as
  
   Windows 8
  
  , and
  
   Windows 8 Pro
  
  , were sold at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Each edition of Windows 8 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and add additional features oriented towards their market segments. For example,
  
   Pro
  
  added
  
   BitLocker
  
  ,
  
   Hyper-V
  
  , the ability to join a
  
   domain
  
  , and the ability to install
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  as a paid add-on. Users of
  
   Windows 8
  
  can purchase a "Pro Pack" license that upgrades their system to
  
   Windows 8 Pro
  
  through
  
   Add features to Windows
  
  . This license also includes Windows Media Center.
  

    [133]
   



    [134]
   



    [135]
   


   Windows 8 Enterprise
  
  contains additional features aimed towards business environments, and is only available through
  
   volume licensing
  
  .
  

    [135]
   

  A port of Windows 8 for
  
   ARM architecture
  
  ,
  
   Windows RT
  
  , is marketed as an edition of Windows 8, but was only included as pre-loaded software on devices specifically developed for it.
  

    [135]
   


  Windows 8 was distributed as a retail box product on
  
   DVD
  
  , and through a
  
   digital download
  
  that could be converted into DVD or
  
   USB
  
  install media. As part of a launch promotion, Microsoft offered
  
   Windows 8 Pro
  
  upgrades at a discounted price of US$39.99 online, or $69.99 for retail box from its launch until January 31, 2013; afterward the
  
   Windows 8
  
  price has been $119.99 and the Pro price $199.99.
  

    [136]
   



    [137]
   

  Those who purchased new PCs pre-loaded with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate between June 2, 2012 and January 31, 2013 could digitally purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade for US$14.99.
  

    [138]
   

  Several PC manufacturers offered
  
   rebates
  
  and refunds on Windows 8 upgrades obtained through the promotion on select models, such as
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  (in the U.S. and Canada on select models), and
  
   Acer
  
  (in Europe on selected
  
   Ultrabook
  
  models).
  

    [139]
   



    [140]
   

  During these promotions, the Windows Media Center add-on for
  
   Windows 8 Pro
  
  was also offered for free.
  

    [133]
   


  Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows 8 was distributed at retail in "Upgrade" licenses only, which require an existing version of Windows to install. The "full version software" SKU, which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all, was discontinued. In lieu of full version, a specialized "System Builder" SKU was introduced. The "System Builder" SKU replaced the
  
   original equipment manufacturer
  
  (OEM) SKU, which was only allowed to be used on PCs meant for resale, but added a "Personal Use License" exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on
  
   homebuilt computers
  
  .
  

    [141]
   



    [142]
   



    [142]
   



    [143]
   


  Retail distribution of Windows 8 has since been discontinued in favor of
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  . Unlike 8, 8.1 is available as "full version software" at both retail and online for download that does not require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed. Pricing for these new copies remain identical.
  

    [144]
   

  With the retail release returning to full version software for Windows 8.1, the "Personal Use License" exemption was removed from the OEM SKU, meaning that end users building their own PCs for personal use must use the full retail version in order to satisfy the Windows 8.1 licensing requirements.
  

    [141]
   


   Windows 8.1 with Bing
  
  is a special OEM-specific SKU of
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  subsidized by Microsoft's
  
   Bing
  
  search engine.
  

    [145]
   


  The three desktop editions of Windows 8 support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures; retail copies of Windows 8 include install DVDs for both architectures, while the online installer automatically installs the version corresponding with the architecture of the system's existing Windows installation.
  

    [133]
   



    [146]
   

  The 32-bit version runs on CPUs compatible with
  
   x86
  
  architecture
  
   3rd generation
  
  (known as
  
   IA-32
  
  ) or newer, and can run
  
   32-bit
  
  and
  
   16-bit
  

   applications
  
  , although 16-bit support must be enabled first.
  

    [147]
   



    [148]
   

  (16-bit applications are developed for CPUs compatible with
  
   x86 2nd generation, first conceived in 1978
  
  . Microsoft started moving away from this architecture after
  
   Windows 95
  
  .
  

    [147]
   

  )
 
  The 64-bit version runs on CPUs compatible with x86
  
   8th generation
  
  (known as
  
   x86-64
  
  , or x64) or newer, and can run 32-bit and
  
   64-bit
  
  programs. 32-bit programs and operating system are restricted to supporting only
  
   4
   
    gigabytes
   

  of memory while 64-bit systems can theoretically support
  
   2048 gigabytes
  
  of memory.
  

    [149]
   

  64-bit operating systems require a different set of device drivers than those of 32-bit operating systems.
  

    [149]
   


  Windows RT, the only edition of Windows 8 for systems with
  
   ARM
  
  processors, only supports applications included with the system (such as a special version of
  
   Office 2013
  
  ), supplied through Windows Update, or Windows Store apps, to ensure that the system only runs applications that are optimized for the architecture. Windows RT does not support running IA-32 or x64 applications.
  

    [150]
   

  Windows Store apps can either support both the x86 and ARM architectures, or compiled to support a specific architecture.
  

    [151]
   


  Following the unveiling of Windows 8, Microsoft faced criticism (particularly from
  
   free software
  
  supporters) for mandating that devices receiving its optional certification for Windows 8 have secure boot enabled by default using a key provided by Microsoft. Concerns were raised that secure boot could
  
   prevent or hinder
  
  the use of alternate operating systems such as
  
   Linux
  
  . In a post discussing secure boot on the
  
   Building Windows 8
  
  blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that "At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves."
  

    [81]
   



    [152]
   

  Microsoft's certification guidelines for Windows 8 ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot in their device's UEFI firmware. It also revealed that
  
   ARM
  
  devices (Windows RT) would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled, with no way for users to disable it. However, Tom Warren of
  
   The Verge
  
  noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including those running Microsoft's own
  
   Windows Phone
  
  platform), but still argued that Microsoft should "keep a consistent approach across ARM and x86, though, not least because of the number of users who'd love to run Android alongside Windows 8 on their future tablets."
  

    [82]
   



    [82]
   



    [83]
   



    [153]
   

  No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.
  

    [154]
   



    [155]
   



    [156]
   


  Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a
  
   closed platform
  
  subject to its own regulations, as it conflicted with their view of the
  
   PC
  
  as an
  
   open platform
  
  .
  
   Markus "Notch" Persson
  
  (creator of the
  
   indie game
  


    Minecraft
   

  ),
  

    [157]
   


   Gabe Newell
  
  (co-founder of
  
   Valve Corporation
  
  and developer of software distribution platform
  
   Steam
  
  ),
  

    [158]
   

  and
  
   Rob Pardo
  
  from
  
   Activision Blizzard
  
  voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store.
  

    [159]
   

  However, Tom Warren of
  
   The Verge
  
  stated that Microsoft's addition of the Store was simply responding to the success of both Apple and Google in pursuing the "curated application store approach."
  

    [160]
   


  Reviews of the various editions of Windows 8 have been mixed. Tom Warren of
  

    The Verge
   

  said that although Windows 8's emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users, he felt that Windows 8 tablets "[make] an
  
   iPad
  
  feel immediately out of date" due to the capabilities of the operating system's hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services.
  

    [160]
   

  David Pierce of
  
   The Verge
  
  described Windows 8 as "the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012" and praised Microsoft's "no compromise" approach and the operating system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services. Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a "brilliant innovation for desktop computers" when compared with "folder-littered desktops on every other OS" because it allows users to interact with dynamic information.
  

    [161]
   

  In contrast, an
  

    ExtremeTech
   

  article said it was Microsoft "flailing"
  

    [162]
   

  and a review in
  

    PC Magazine
   

  condemned the Metro-style user interface.
  

    [163]
   

  Some of the included apps in Windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality, but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi-platform entertainment experience. Other improvements and features (such as File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager) were also regarded as positive changes.
  

    [160]
   

  Peter Bright of
  
   Ars Technica
  
  wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them, Windows 8's improved performance, updated file manager, new storage functionality, expanded security features, and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system. Bright also said that Windows 8's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an "extremely ambitious" aspect of the platform as well, but criticized Microsoft for emulating
  
   Apple
  
  's model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store.
  

    [164]
   


  The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping "wasn't very obvious" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the
  
   RTM
  
  release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this "
  
   stumbling block
  
  ", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the "Metro" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means.
  

    [164]
   

  Tom Warren of
  
   The Verge
  
  wrote that the new interface was "as stunning as it is surprising", contributing to an "incredibly personal" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store.
  

    [160]
   

  Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from
  
   ZDNet
  
  , considered the interface to be "clumsy and impractical" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it "two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together"), and concluded that "Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets – that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad."
  

    [165]
   


  In 2013, Frank X. Shaw, a Microsoft corporate vice president, said that while many of the negative reviews were extreme, it was a "good thing" that Microsoft was "listening to feedback and improving a product".
  

    [166]
   


  The
  
   American Customer Satisfaction Index
  
  (ACSI) reported a decline in Microsoft's customer satisfaction, the lowest it has been since
  
   Windows Vista
  
  .
  

    [167]
   


  Microsoft says that 4 million users upgraded to Windows 8 over the weekend after its release,
  

    [168]
   



    [169]
   

  which CNET says was well below Microsoft's internal projections and was described inside the company as disappointing.
  

    [170]
   


  On November 27, 2012, Microsoft announced that it has sold 40 million licenses of Windows 8 in the first month, surpassing the pace of Windows 7.
  

    [171]
   


  However, according to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to the same time period in 2011.
  

    [172]
   

  As the holiday shopping season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued to lag, even as Apple reported brisk sales.
  

    [173]
   

  The market research firm
  
   IDC
  
  reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features.
  

    [174]
   

  This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region, as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs.
  

    [175]
   


  Windows 8 surpassed
  
   Windows Vista
  
  in market share with a 5.1% usage rate according to numbers posted in July 2013 by
  
   Net Applications
  
  , with usage on a steady upward trajectory.
  

    [176]
   

  However, intake of Windows 8 still lags behind that of
  
   Windows Vista
  
  and
  
   Windows 7
  
  at the same point in their release cycles. Windows 8's tablet market share has also been growing steadily, with 7.4% of tablets running Windows in Q1 2013 according to Strategy Analytics, up from nothing just a year before. However, this is still well below
  
   Android
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  , which posted 43.4% and 48.2% market share respectively, although both operating systems have been on the market much longer than Windows 8.
  

    [177]
   

  Strategy Analytics also noted "a shortage of top tier apps" for Windows tablets despite Microsoft strategy of paying developers to create apps for the operating system (in addition to for Windows Phone).
  

    [177]
   


  In March 2013, Microsoft also amended its certification requirements to allow tablets to use the 1024×768 resolution as a minimum; this change is expected to allow the production of certified Windows 8 tablets in smaller form factors—a market which is currently dominated by Android-based tablets.
  

    [129]
   

  Despite the reaction of industry experts, Microsoft reported that they had sold 100 million licenses in the first six months. This matched sales of Windows 7 over a similar period.
  

    [178]
   

  This statistic includes shipments to channel warehouses which now need to be sold in order to make way for new shipments.
  

    [179]
   


  In January 2014,
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  began a promotion for desktops running Windows 7, saying that it was "back by popular demand". Outside sources have suggested that this might be because HP or its customers thought the Windows 8 platform would be more appropriate for mobile computing than desktop computing, or that they were looking to attract customers forced to switch from XP who wanted a more familiar interface.
  

    [180]
   



    [181]
   


  In February 2014,
  
   Bloomberg
  
  reported that Microsoft would be lowering the price of Windows 8 licenses by 70% for devices that retail under US$250; alongside the announcement that an update to the operating system would allow OEMs to produce devices with as little as 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage, critics felt that these changes would help Windows compete against Linux-based devices in the low-end market, particularly those running
  
   Chrome OS
  
  . Microsoft had similarly cut the price of
  
   Windows XP

  Reports also indicated that Microsoft was planning to offer cheaper Windows 8 licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer's default search engine to
  
   Bing
  
  . Some media outlets falsely reported that the SKU associated with this plan, "Windows 8.1 with Bing", was a variant which would be a free or low-cost version of Windows 8 for consumers using older versions of Windows.
  

    [184]
   

  On April 2, 2014, Microsoft ultimately announced that it would be removing license fees entirely for devices with screens smaller than 9 inches,
  

    [185]
   

  and officially confirmed the rumored "Windows 8.1 with Bing" OEM SKU on May 23, 2014.
  

    [145]
   


  On the information gathered by Net Applications, adoption rate in March 2015 for Windows 8.1 was at 10.55%, while the original Windows 8 was at 3.52%.

  In May 2014, the
  
   Government of China
  
  banned the internal purchase of Windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring "energy-efficient" devices. The
  
   Xinhua News Agency
  
  claimed that Windows 8 was being banned in protest of Microsoft's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for
  
   Windows XP
  
  (which, as of January 2014, had a market share of 49% in China), as the government "obviously cannot ignore the risks of running an OS without guaranteed technical support." However, Ni Guangnan of the
  
   Chinese Academy of Sciences
  
  had also previously warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to
  
   surveillance by the United States government
  
  due to its heavy use of Internet-based services.

  In June 2014,
  
   state broadcaster
  

   China Central Television
  
  (CCTV) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security. The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan, who stated that operating systems could aggregate "sensitive user information" that could be used to "understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society", and alleged that per
  
   documents leaked by Edward Snowden
  
  , the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information. Yang Min, a computer scientist at
  
   Fudan University
  
  , also stated that "the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security." Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network
  
   Sina Weibo
  
  , which stated that the company had never "assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients" or provided client data to the U.S. government, never "provided any government the authority to directly visit" or placed any
  
   backdoors
  
  in its products and services, and that it had never concealed government requests for client data.

  An upgrade to Windows 8 known as
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  was officially announced by Microsoft on May 14, 2013.
  

    [194]
   



    [195]
   

  Following a presentation devoted to the upgrade at
  
   Build 2013
  
  , a public beta version of the upgrade was released on June 26, 2013.
  

    [196]
   



    [197]
   

  Windows 8.1 was released to
  
   OEM hardware partners
  
  on August 27, 2013, and released publicly as a free download through Windows Store on October 17, 2013.

  Volume license customers and subscribers to
  
   MSDN Plus
  
  and
  
   TechNet Plus
  
  were initially unable to obtain the RTM version upon its release; a spokesperson said the policy was changed to allow Microsoft to work with OEMs "to ensure a quality experience at general availability."
  

    [200]
   



    [201]
   

  However, after criticism, Microsoft reversed its decision and released the RTM build on MSDN and TechNet on September 9, 2013.
  

    [202]
   


  The upgrade addressed a number of criticisms faced by Windows 8 upon its release, with additional customization options for the Start screen, the restoration of a visible Start button on the desktop, the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display, and the ability to boot to the desktop instead of the Start screen. Windows 8's stock apps were also updated, a new
  
   Bing
  
  -based unified search system was added,
  
   SkyDrive
  
  was given deeper integration with the operating system, and a number of new stock apps, along with a tutorial, were added.

  Windows 8.1 also added support for
  
   3D printing
  
  ,
  

    [206]
   



    [207]
   


   Miracast
  
  media streaming,
  
   NFC
  
  printing, and
  
   Wi-Fi Direct
  
  .

  Microsoft markets Windows 8.1 as an "update" rather than as a "
  
   service pack
  
  " or "upgrade".
  

    [209]
   

  However, Microsoft's support lifecycle policy treats Windows 8.1 similarly to previous Windows service packs: it is part of Windows 8's support lifecycle, and upgrading to 8.1 is required to maintain access to mainstream support and
  
   Windows updates
  
  after January 12, 2016. This also means that support for several versions of Internet Explorer Web browser (IE10 or below) will be discontinued.

  Retail and OEM copies of
  
   Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro
  
  , and
  
   Windows RT
  
  can be upgraded through
  
   Windows Store
  
  free of charge. However,
  
   volume license
  
  customers, TechNet or MSDN subscribers and users of
  
   Windows 8 Enterprise
  
  must acquire a standalone installation media for 8.1 and install through the traditional Windows setup process, either as an in-place upgrade or clean install. This requires an 8.1-specific product key.
