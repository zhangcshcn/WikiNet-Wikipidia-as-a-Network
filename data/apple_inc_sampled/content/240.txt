   Kodi
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC
  
  ) is a
  
   free and open-source
  

   media player
  
  software application developed by the XBMC Foundation, a
  
   non-profit
  
  technology
  
   consortium
  
  .
  

    [4]
   

  Kodi is available for multiple operating systems and hardware platforms, with a software
  
   10-foot user interface
  
  for use with televisions and
  
   remote controls
  
  . It allows users to play and view most streaming media, such as videos, music,
  
   podcasts
  
  , and videos from the internet, as well as all common
  
   digital media
  
  files from local and network
  
   storage media
  
  .
  

    [5]
   


  It is a
  
   multi-platform
  

   home-theater PC
  
  (HTPC) application. Kodi is highly customizable: a variety of
  
   skins
  
  can change its appearance, and various
  
   plug-ins
  
  allow users to access
  
   streaming media
  
  content via online services such as
  
   Amazon Prime Instant Video
  
  ,
  
   Crackle
  
  ,
  
   Pandora Internet Radio
  
  ,
  
   Rhapsody
  
  ,
  
   Spotify
  
  , and
  
   YouTube
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  The later versions also have a personal video-recorder (PVR) graphical
  
   front end
  
  for receiving live television with
  
   electronic program guide
  
  (EPG) and high-definition
  
   digital video recorder
  
  (DVR) support.
  

    [7]
   


  The software was created as an independently developed
  
   homebrew
  
  media player application named
  
   Xbox Media Center
  
  (abbreviated as XBMC) for the first-generation
  
   Xbox
  
  game console,
  

    [5]
   



    [8]
   



    [9]
   

  and was later made available under the name XBMC as a native application for
  
   Android
  
  ,
  
   Linux
  
  ,
  
   BSD
  
  ,
  
   macOS
  
  ,
  
   iOS
  
  /
  
   tvOS
  
  , and
  
   Microsoft Windows
  
  -based operating systems.
  

    [10]
   



    [11]
   


  Because of its open source and
  
   cross-platform
  
  nature, with its core code written in
  
   C++
  
  , modified versions of Kodi/XBMC together with a
  
   JeOS
  
  have been used as a
  
   software appliance
  
  suite or
  
   software framework
  
  in a variety of devices including
  
   smart TVs
  
  ,
  
   set-top boxes
  
  , digital signage, hotel television systems,
  
   network connected media players
  
  and embedded systems based on
  
   armhf
  
  platform like
  
   Raspberry Pi
  
  . Derivative applications such as
  
   MediaPortal
  
  and
  
   Plex
  
  have been spun off from XBMC or Kodi, as well as
  
   Just enough operating systems
  
  like
  
   OpenELEC
  
  and
  
   LibreELEC
  
  .

  Kodi has attracted negative attention for its use on third-party hardware devices that are designed to facilitate the
  
   infringement
  
  of copyrights by offering add-ons which provide unauthorized access to copyrighted content. These devices, and the add-ons that facilitate this infringement, are not affiliated with the Kodi project. The XBMC Foundation has not endorsed any of these products, and has threatened legal action against those using its
  
   trademarks
  
  to promote them.
  

    [17]
   




  Kodi supports most common audio, video, and image formats, playlists, audio visualizations, slideshows, weather forecasts reporting, and third-party plugins. It is network-capable (internet and
  
   home network
  
  shares). Unlike other media center applications such as
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  ,
  
   MediaPortal
  
  and
  
   MythTV
  
  , Kodi does not include its own internal digital TV-tuner code for
  
   Live TV
  
  or DVR/PVR recording functionality, as instead it acts as a unified DVR/PVR front-end with an EPG TV-Guide GUI interface which, via a common API interface, abstracts and supports multiple back-ends via PVR client add-ons from third parties, with those running either locally on the same machine or over the network.

   Plug-ins
  
  , using either C/C++ programming languages to create Binary Addons or the
  
   Python scripting language
  
  to create Script Addons, expand Kodi to include features such as television program guides,
  
   YouTube
  
  ,
  
   Hulu
  
  ,
  
   Netflix
  
  ,
  
   Veoh
  
  , online movie trailer support, and Pandora Radio and
  
   podcast
  
  streaming. Kodi also functions as a game launcher on any operating system.

  Kodi's
  
   source code
  
  is distributed as open source under the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  (GPL),
  

    [18]
   

  it is governed by the tax-exempt registered non-profit US organization, XBMC Foundation, and is owned and developed by a global free software community of unpaid volunteers.
  

    [22]
   



    [23]
   


  Even though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, XBMC on the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project "
  
   XBMC4Xbox
  
  ", which forked the Xbox version of the software and completely took over the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox. The ending of Xbox support by the original project was also the reason that it was renamed "XBMC" from the old "Xbox Media Center" name, and why it later was renamed "Kodi".
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   



    [26]
   



    [27]
   

  The Xbox version of XBMC had the ability to launch console games, and
  
   homebrew
  
  applications such as
  
   emulators
  
  . Since the XBMC for Xbox version was never distributed, endorsed, or supported by Microsoft, it always required a
  
   modchip
  
  or
  
   softmod exploit
  
  to run on the Xbox game-console.

  Kodi has greater basic hardware requirements than traditional 2D style software applications: it needs a
  
   3D
  
  capable
  
   graphics hardware controller
  
  for all rendering. Powerful 3D GPU chips are common today in most modern computer platforms, including many
  
   set-top boxes
  
  , and XBMC, now Kodi, was from the start designed to be otherwise very resource efficient for being as powerful and versatile framework as it is. It runs well on what (by
  
   Intel Atom
  
  standards) are relatively underpowered
  
   OpenGL 1.3
  
  (with
  
   GLSL
  
  support),
  
   OpenGL ES 2.0
  
  or
  
   Direct3D (DirectX) 9.0
  
  capable systems that are
  
   IA-32
  
  /
  
   x86
  
  ,
  
   x86-64
  
  ,
  
   ARM
  
  (AArch32 and AArch64), or
  
   PowerPC G4
  
  or later
  
   CPU
  
  based.
  

    [12]
   


  When software decoding of a Full HD
  
   1080p
  
  high-definition and high bit-rate video is performed by the system
  
   CPU
  
  , a
  
   dual-core
  
  2 GHz or faster CPU is required in order to allow for perfectly smooth playback without dropping
  
   frames
  
  or giving playback a jerky appearance. Kodi can however offload most of the video decoding process onto graphics hardware controller or embedded video processing circuits that supports one of the following types of hardware-accelerated
  
   video decoding
  
  :
  

    [28]
   

  Google's MediaCodec API for Android, Intel's
  
   VAAPI
  
  , Nvidia's
  
   VDPAU
  
  API, AMD's
  
   XvBA
  
  API, Microsoft's
  
   DXVA
  
  API, Apple's VDADecoder/VideoToolBox APIs, and the Khronos Group's
  
   OpenMAX
  
  API,
  

    [29]
   



    [30]
   


   AMLogic
  
  VPU,
  

    [31]
   


   Freescale
  
  's
  
   i.MX6x series
  
  VPU, and
  
   Raspberry Pi
  
  's GPU MMAL. By taking advantage of such hardware-accelerated video decoding, Kodi can play back most videos on many inexpensive, low-performance systems, as long as they contain a supported VPU or GPU.
 
  Kodi includes full
  
   internationalization and localization
  
  support with translations to many different languages by default, with its language files translated to over 75 languages to date.
  

    [3]
   

  Kodi's structure is such that if the language is not available, or not up-to-date, it can be made by editing simple
  
   strings
  
  in an
  
   XML
  
  -file, which can then be submitted to XBMC's project management and
  
   bug tracking system
  
  tool for use by others, and after version 11.0 XBMC switched to using
  
   GetText PO (Portable Object) formatted files
  
  for more easily handled translator translations using
  
   Transifex
  
  web-based translation platform with online
  
   crowd-sourced
  
  translation services.
  

    [32]
   

  The latest version of XBMC supports over 74 languages.
  

    [33]
   



    [34]
   


  Kodi features several open
  
   APIs
  
  to enable
  
   third-party developers
  
  to create capabilities which extend Kodi with a multitude of
  
   addons
  
  , such as audio and video streaming plugins for online sources, screensavers, skins/themes, visualizations, weather forecasts, web interfaces, web scrapers, widget scripts, and more. Kodi developers encourage users to make and submit their own addons to expand media content and
  
   value-added services
  
  accessible from within Kodi.
 
  Kodi/XBMC features, since version 10.0 (codename: "Dharma"), an Addons Framework architecture and an Addons Manager GUI client that connects to a
  
   decentralized
  

   digital distribution
  
  service
  
   platform
  
  that serves add-on apps and
  
   plug-ins
  
  which among other things provide online content to Kodi, the "Addons Manager" (or "Addons Browser") inside Kodi allows users to browse and download new addons directly from Kodi's GUI.
 
  Many of these online content sources are in
  
   over-the-top content
  
  high definition services and use video streaming site as sources for the media content that is offered. Kodi has extensibility and integration with online sources for free and premium streaming content, and offers content from everything from commercial video to free educational programming, and media from individuals and small businesses. Not all content sources on add-ons are available in every country, however. Due to rights agreements, many content sources are geo-restricted to prevent users in outside countries from accessing content, although some have taken to bypassing the regional restrictions in order to unblock these sources, disregarding the usage rights.
  

    [35]
   


  Kodi features an integrated Python Scripts interpreter for addon extensions, and WindowXML
  
   application framework
  
  (a XML-based
  
   widget toolkit
  
  engine for creating a GUI for apps and
  
   widgets
  
  ) in a similar fashion to Apple macOS
  
   Dashboard Widgets
  
  and
  
   Microsoft Gadgets
  
  . Python widget scripts allow normal users to add new functionality to Kodi themselves, using Python scripting language. Current
  
   plugin
  
  scripts include functions like
  
   Internet-TV
  
  and
  
   movie-trailer
  
  browsers, cinemaguides, weather forecast,
  
   over-the-top content
  
  video streaming services like YouTube,
  
   BBC iPlayer
  
  ,
  
   Hulu
  
  ,
  
   Netflix
  
  ,
  
   Veoh
  
  ,
  
   MLB.tv
  
  , Internet-radio-station browsers such as Pandora Radio, online picture sharing sites like
  
   Flickr
  
  , TV guides such as
  
   TVShow Time
  
  , e-mail clients,
  
   instant messaging
  
  , different timetables,
  
   home automation
  
  scripts to
  
   front-end
  
  control PVR software and hardware,
  
   P2P
  
  file-sharing downloaders (
  
   BitTorrent
  
  ),
  
   IRC
  
  , also
  
   casual games
  
  such as
  

    Tetris

  Kodi has the built-in optional function to automatically download
  
   metadata
  
  information,
  
   cover art
  
  and other related media artwork online through its
  
   web scrapers
  
  that looks for media in the user's audio and video folders and their sub-directories. These "scrapers" are used as
  
   importers
  
  to obtain detailed information from various Internet resources about movies and television shows. It can get synopses, reviews, movie posters, titles, genre classification, and other similar data. XBMCGUI then provides a rich display for audio and video files that the scrapers have identified.
 
  Scrapers use sites like
  
   The Movie Database
  
  (TMDb)
  

    [36]
   

  or
  
   IMDb.com
  
  to obtain
  
   thumbnails
  
  and information on movies,
  
   thetvdb.com
  
  for TV show posters and episode plots,
  
   CDDB
  
  for audio CD track listings, and
  
   Allmusic (AMG)
  
  and
  
   MusicBrainz
  
  for album
  
   thumbnails
  
  , reviews, and metadata.
  

    [28]
   


  Fanart.tv has been added to the list of information sources
  

    [37]
   

  and XBMC can use it to retrieve logos, backgrounds, CDs with transparent backgrounds, album covers and banners among other image types for music artists, TV shows and movies, the popularity of which contributed to XBMC being able to handle new image types.
 
  Like the majority of applications that originated from a '
  
   homebrew
  
  ' scene, modification and customization of the interface using
  
   skins
  
  is very popular among Kodi users and hundreds of skins and themes are available for users to install. The Kodi skinning engine's flexibility is also advantageous to third parties wanting to create derivative works, as it facilitates rebranding the environment and making deeper changes to the look and feel of the user interface.
 
  The skins "Estuary" and "Estouchy" are the two official default for; Kodi with an ever-evolving variance of "Confluence" being the default set-top box style skin designed for large screen televisions and displays since XBMC version 9.11, and "Touch" which introduced with XBMC version 11.0 being design for small screen devices with
  
   touchscreen displays
  
  , such as
  
   iPad
  
  tablets. "Project Mayhem" had been the default before XBMC version 9.1; this skin is now in its third version, commonly known as "PM3.HD" (
  
   PM III High-Definition
  
  ).
  

    [6]
   


  Users can also create their own skin (or simply modify an existing skin) and share it with others via public websites that are used for Kodi skin trading and development.
  

    [38]
   

  Many such third-party skins exist that are well maintained by the community, and while some skins are originals with unique designs, most begin as a clone or an exact replica of other multimedia software interfaces, such as
  
   Apple Front Row
  
  ,
  
   Windows Media Center Edition
  
  (MCE), MediaPortal,
  
   Wii Channel Menu (Xii)
  
  ,
  
   Xbox 360 interface
  
  , and others.
  

    [39]
   


  In addition to skins and themes users can create a themed package called a 'build'. Within this package homebrew developers are able to distribute a skin and multiple addons. The delivery mechanism used within the Kodi scene is called a wizard with the Replicant Wizard
  

    [40]
   

  being the most prominent.
 
  Web Interface addons for Kodi normally allow browsing a media library remotely, to handle music playlists from a computer instead of television. Others allow remotely controlling the navigation of XBMC like a remote for
  
   remote controlling
  
  of an installed and concurrently active Kodi session running on a computer if it runs on an internet tablet or similar device with a touch interface. Others act like a media manager to allow modifying metadata and artwork in XBMC's video and music libraries.
 
  Kodi has a "My Programs" section which is meant to function as an application launcher for third-party
  
   software
  
  such as computer games and
  
   video game emulators
  
  , all from a
  
   GUI
  
  with
  
   thumbnail
  
  and different listings options. However, while this feature was fully functioning on the Xbox version of XBMC, it is still in its infant stage on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows, thus requiring third-party launcher plugins to function properly.
  

    [9]
   


  From version 12.0 (Frodo) Kodi has a native Live TV with
  
   EPG (Electronic Program Guide)
  
  and
  
   DVR (Digital Video Recorder)
  
  features with a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) frontend GUI,
  

    [41]
   



    [42]
   

  enabling
  
   video capture
  
  and playback to and from a
  
   hard disk drive
  
  with PVR Client Addons for most popular PVR backends (
  
   TV tuner card
  
  server) that can be installed separately as plugins in XBMC.
 
  PVR backend can either be networked DVR set-top box hardware or PC-based digital video recorder software which can run on the same computer or other computers on the same network. PVR software and hardware is available which can turn computers or appliances running
  
   Linux
  
  ,
  
   macOS
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft Windows
  
  , and
  
   Android
  
  devices into DVRs.
  

    [43]
   


  PVR Client Addons are available for many PVR software and hardware such as Argus TV, DVBLogic DVBLink,
  
   DVBViewer
  
  , ForTheRecord, Tvheadend,
  
   MediaPortal
  
  ,
  
   MythTV
  
  ,
  
   NextPVR
  
  (formerly
  
   GB-PVR
  
  ),
  
   VDR
  
  ,
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  , and Enigma2-based DVR set-top boxes such as
  
   Dreambox
  
  ,
  
   DBox2
  
  , and
  
   Vu+
  
  .,
  

    [44]
   

  as well as PVR Client Addons for direct LAN connection to network-attached TV-Tuners such as
  
   HDHomeRun
  
  , PCTV Systems Broadway,
  
   VBox Home TV Gateway
  
  , and Njoy Digital AnySee N7 DVB-S2 Network-Tuner.
  

    [45]
   

  There is also a PVR Client Addon for the internet-based television providers
  
   FilmOn
  
  (FilmOn.TV Networks), and Stalker Middleware, as well as a simple PVR client addon for
  
   IPTV
  
  in general.
 
  Kodi can play media from CD/DVD media using an internal
  
   DVD-ROM
  
  drive. It can play media from an internal built-in
  
   hard disk drive
  
  and
  
   SMB/SAMBA/CIFS
  
  shares (Windows File-Sharing), or stream them over
  
   ReplayTV
  
  DVRs/PVRs,
  
   Universal Plug and Play
  
  (UPnP) or
  
   Digital Living Network Alliance
  
  (DLNA) shares, or stream
  
   iTunes
  
  -shares via
  
   Digital Audio Access Protocol
  
  (DAAP). Kodi can take advantage of a broadband Internet connection if available to stream Internet-video-streams like YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and Veoh, and play Internet-radio-stations (such as
  
   Pandora Radio
  
  ). Kodi includes the option to submit music usage statistics to
  
   Last.fm
  
  and
  
   Libre.fm
  
  . It has music/video-playlist features, picture/image-slideshow functions, an MP3+CDG
  
   karaoke
  
  function and many
  
   audio-visualizations
  
  and
  
   screensavers
  
  . Kodi can
  
   upscale/upconvert
  
  all
  
   standard-definition
  
  resolution videos and output them to
  
   720p, 1080i, and 1080p high-definition
  
  resolutions.
  

    [12]
   



    [18]
   



    [46]
   


  Under Microsoft Windows, Kodi supports Directsound and WASAPI; since
  
   WASAPI
  
  performs no mixing or resampling, it provides best audio quality.
  

    [47]
   


  Kodi can be used to play/view all common multimedia formats through its native clients and parsers. It can decode these audio and video formats in software or hardware, and optionally pass-through
  
   AC3
  
  /
  
   DTS
  
  audio, or encode to AC3 in real time from movies directly to
  
   S/PDIF
  
  digital output to an external audio-
  
   amplifier
  
  /
  
   receiver
  
  for decoding.
  

    [12]
   



    [18]
   


  The Video Library, one of the Kodi
  
   metadata
  
  databases, is a key feature of Kodi. It allows the organization of video content by information associated with the video files (e.g., movies and recorded TV shows) themselves. This information can be obtained in various ways, like through scrapers (e.g.,
  
   web scraping
  
  sites like IMDb, TheMovieDB, TheTVDB), and
  
   nfo
  
  files. Automatically downloading and displaying movie posters and fan art backdrops as background wallpapers. The Library Mode view allows users to browse their video content by categories; Genre, Title, Year, Actors and Directors.
  

    [6]
   



    [12]
   


  Kodi uses one multimedia video player "core" for video-playback. This video-player "core" for video-playback is an in-house developed cross-platform media player, "DVDPlayer", which was designed to play back
  
   DVD-Video
  
  movies, and this includes support native for DVD-menus, (based on the free open source libraries code
  
   libdvdcss
  
  and libdvdnav). This
  
   FFmpeg
  
  based video-player "core" today supports all widespread mainstream formats. One relatively unusual feature of this DVD-player core is the capability to on-the-fly pause and play DVD-Video movies that are stored in
  
   ISO and IMG
  
  DVD-images or DVD-Video (
  
   IFO
  
  /
  
   VOB
  
  /
  
   BUP
  
  ) images (even directly from uncompressed
  
   RAR
  
  and
  
   ZIP
  
  archives), from either local harddrive storage or network-share storage.
  

    [6]
   



    [12]
   



    [13]
   


  The Music Library, one of the Kodi metadata databases, is another key feature of Kodi. It allows the organization of a music collection to allow searching, and creating smart playlists by information stored in music file
  
   ID meta tags
  
  , like title, artist, album, production year, genre, and popularity. Automatically downloading and displaying album covers and
  
   fan art
  
  backdrops as background wallpapers.
  

    [6]
   



    [12]
   


  For music playback, Kodi includes its own in-house developed audio-player, "PAPlayer" (which stands for "Psycho-Acoustic Audio Player"), and this audio-player core's most notable features are on-the-fly
  
   resampling
  
  of the audio frequency,
  
   gapless playback
  
  ,
  
   crossfading
  
  ,
  
   ReplayGain
  
  ,
  
   cue sheet
  
  and Ogg Chapter support.
 
  The PAPlayer audio-player handles a very large variety of audio file-formats and supports most tagging standards. Kodi also has support for most popular karaoke computer file formats, and is able to play and display timed song lyrics graphics/text from
  
   CD+G
  
  ,
  
   LRC
  
  , and KAR files.

  Kodi handles all common
  
   digital picture/image formats
  
  with the options of panning/zooming and slideshow with "
  
   Ken Burns Effect
  
  ", with the use of CxImage open source library code. XBMC can handle CBZ (ZIP) and CBR (RAR)
  
   comic book archive files
  
  , this feature lets users view/read, browse and zoom the pictures of comics pages these contain without uncompressing them first.

  Development was in progress in 2013
  

    [update]
   

  on new core features integrating a built-in Games Manager and Game Launcher front-end GUI with a Games Library, and
  
   Game Console Emulator
  
  API into XBMC. The code for all was being developed in a separate branch to be incorporated into the mainline tree.
  

    [52]
   


  The Games Manager, once integrated into Kodi, provides a unified
  
   Games
  
  Manager Library and GUI front-end launcher with online metadata web scraping support for information about the games. It also introduces Game Addons as new type of addons with just-in-time emulator installation. Adding a Games Library for Game Metadata, exposing info (current level, number of lives, number of coins earned, etc.) to GUI, as well as extending the Addon API to support Game Client Addons, supporting Kodi's VFS (Virtual File System). It also provides a joystick and gamepad abstraction layer for common joystick API and input clients.

  Also under development was the "RetroPlayer"
  
   video game console emulator
  
  (
  
   ROMs
  
  ) interface supporting the libretro API and emulator cores (from the RetroArch project, which is its reference front-end). Libretro itself is a modular multi-system game/emulator system designed to be fast, lightweight, and portable.
  

    [55]
   


  This RetroPlayer can via libretro emulator API support emulators for most popular retro game consoles, including but not exclusively;

  There are many software applications for mobile devices available for and associated with Kodi. Some of these mobile apps just works as simple remote controls, while others function as more advanced
  
   second screen
  
  companion apps, offering additional information about what users are viewing or listening to on Kodi, such as
  
   metadata
  
  about movie actors and music artists, with links to other works available from those persons in their collection or online.
 
  "XBMC Remote for Android" and "XBMC Remote for iOS" are free and open source official apps for mobile devices released by Team-Kodi/Team-XBMC on
  
   Google Play
  
  for
  
   Android
  
  devices and the
  
   App Store
  
  for
  
   iOS Devices
  
  , such as
  
   iPad
  
  ,
  
   iPhone
  
  , and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  . These applications act as a second screen
  

    [58]
   

  and remote control solution which allows for fully browsing the media library and for
  
   remote controlling
  
  of an installed and concurrently active XBMC session running on a computer via the handheld touchscreen user interface of these device.
  

    [59]
   



    [60]
   


  Several third-party developers have also released multiple other unofficial Kodi remote control apps for iOS, Android,
  
   BlackBerry
  
  ,
  
   Symbian
  
  ,
  
   Ubuntu Touch
  
  ,
  
   Windows Mobile
  
  , and
  
   Windows Phone
  
  devices. Some of these remote control apps are made specifically for controlling Kodi, while some universal remote control apps are capable of controlling many different media center and media player applications, and some of these third-party remote apps cost money while others are free.

  Due to the dated hardware of the first-generation Xbox game console, that Kodi/XBMC was designed for, and a desire to expand the project's end-user and developer-base, many official
  
   ports
  
  of XBMC to computer operating-systems and hardware platforms now exist. Through the processing power of modern computer hardware, XBMC is able to decode
  
   high-definition video
  
  up to and beyond
  
   1080p
  
  resolutions, bypassing hardware limitations of the Xbox version of XBMC.
 
  However, in the latest official release of Kodi/XBMC there is
  
   hardware accelerated video decoding
  
  for
  
   DXVA
  
  ,
  
   VDPAU
  
  ,
  
   VA-API
  
  GPU hardware video decoding, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via
  
   ARM NEON
  
  , and
  
   OpenMAX
  
  , Broadcom Crystal HD.
  

    [13]
   



    [62]
   

  The source code for XBMC is actively updated by developers in a public
  
   Git repository
  
  , which may contain features and functionality not yet incorporated into the most recent "stable" releases.
 
  Kodibuntu (formerly
  
   XBMCbuntu
  
  ) was a free
  
   Ubuntu
  
  -based
  
   Linux distribution
  
  with Kodi (formerly
  
   XBMC
  
  ) for Linux already installed and pre-configured, providing a complete packaged media center software suite for all IA-32/x86-based personal computers. Kodibuntu uses Kodi software for all media playback and is primarily designed for
  
   bare-metal installations
  
  to achieve
  
   instant-on
  
  type
  
   boot
  
  to achieve a set-top box experience on an HTPC. It replaces XBMCbuntu that in turn replaced XBMC Live, which was formerly the official
  
   Live CD
  
  (Linux) distribution.
  

    [63]
   


  Kodibuntu was based on
  
   Lubuntu
  
  , an Ubuntu Linux fork that is "lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient" than the standard Ubuntu desktop distributions. The
  
   Windows XP Media Center Edition
  
  Remote and IR-receiver dongle works with Kodibuntu directly out of the box, which mean that Windows Media Center users with these can try out the Kodibuntu without requiring any additional hardware.
  

    [11]
   



    [64]
   



    [65]
   


  Following the principles of
  
   MythTV distributions
  
  and
  
   GeeXboX
  
  , Kodibuntu is designed to simplify a permanent installation of Kodi onto a computer to be used as a dedicated home theater PC in the living-room, as such the user can directly install XBMC from the bootable CD to either a USB flash drive or to an internal hard disk drive as it comes with a complete instant-on (
  
   Linux kernel
  
  -based)
  
   embedded operating system
  
  . When installed onto a USB flash drive or internal hard disk drive, Kodibuntu has the ability to save settings and make updates to XBMC and the operating-system back onto the USB flash drive or hard disk drive that it is installed onto.
 

   Kodi for Linux
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC for Linux
  
  ) is primarily developed for Ubuntu Linux and Kodi's developers' own Kodibuntu (formerly
  
   XBMCbuntu
  
  ). Third-party packages for most other Linux distributions are however available, and it is also possible to compile XBMC Media Center from scratch for any Linux distribution as long as the prerequired dependency libraries are installed first. Hardware accelerated video decoding is achieved via the
  
   VDPAU
  
  API on Nvidia's GPUs, and via the
  
   VAAPI
  
  API for
  
   AMD/ATI Radeon
  
  ,
  
   S3 Graphics
  
  , and Intel's newer
  
   Integrated Graphics Processors
  
  , as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via
  
   OpenMAX
  
  ,
  
   ARM NEON
  
  , Broadcom Crystal HD on systems with supporting hardware.
  

    [62]
   

  Development version of Kodi/XBMC for Linux is available at
  
   Launchpad
  
  as
  
   PPA (Personal Package Archive)
  
  for the standard Ubuntu Desktop version 8.04 and later, as well as
  
   DEB packages
  
  for
  
   Debian
  
  .
 

   Kodi for OS X
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC for Mac
  
  ) runs natively on
  
   Mac OS X Tiger
  
  and later, as well as on the Apple TV. 1080p playback can be achieved on
  
   Apple
  
  computers either via software decoding on the CPU if it is powerful enough, or by hardware accelerated video decoding for hardware supporting Apple's VDA API, or video decoders such as the Broadcom Crystal HD.
  

    [62]
   


  1080p playback on the first-generation Apple TV (a.k.a. "ATV1") can only be achieved by hardware accelerated video decoding via Broadcom Crystal HD; the user must replace the ATV's internal WiFi adapter with a Broadcom Crystal HD
  
   PCI Express Mini (mini-PCIe) card
  
  in order to activate this functionality.
  

    [62]
   



   Kodi for Windows
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC for Windows
  
  ) runs natively on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, it is a
  
   32-bit
  
  application but runs on
  
   64-bit
  
  Windows and hardware as well, however it is not yet optimized for that architecture so there is no performance gain when running on 64-bit Windows. 1080p playback can be achieved on Windows based computers either via software decoding on the CPU if it's powerful enough, or by hardware accelerated video decoding.
 
  Hardware video decoding via
  
   DirectX Video Acceleration
  


    [66]
   



    [67]
   

  is now supported although this enhancement currently only runs on Windows 7 since it utilizes the DXVA 2.0 API which is not supported in Windows XP.
  

    [68]
   



   Kodi for iOS
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC for iOS
  
  ), which is a full port of Kodi to Apple's iOS operating-system, was first announced and released publicly on 20 January 2011. It supports both 720p and 1080p hardware accelerated video decoding of
  
   H.264
  
  videos, and is compatible with all Apple's iDevices that uses
  
   Apple A4
  
  or
  
   Apple A5
  
  (ARM-based) processors with a jailbroken iOS operating-system.
  

    [69]
   



   Kodi for Android
  
  (formerly
  
   XBMC for Android
  
  ) is a full port of the complete Kodi/XBMC application to Google's Android operating-system, officially compatible with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later versions supporting
  
   API Level 14
  
  .
  

    [70]
   

  was first announced and its source code released publicly on 13 June 2012. This is a full port of Kodi's
  
   C++
  
  and C source code with all its dependencies to Android with a build-system that was designed to handle multiple processor architectures, like ARM, MIPS, and x86 with the
  
   Android NDK (Native Development Kit for Android)
  
  without using a single line of Java, and the XBMC.APK is running natively under Android as a NativeActivity application.
  

    [71]
   

  Hardware accelerated video decoding on Android is currently only officially available for some specific hardware platforms, such as the
  
   Amlogic
  
  SoC based Pivos XIOS series which have been used as the reference hardware platform during the development so far.
  

    [72]
   

  XBMC source code must be compiled with Google's official Android NDK revision 10d or later, and be built for the
  
   android-17
  
  toolchain (Android API Level 17) using
  
   GCC
  
  version 4.8, which Kodi for Android code currently requires to compile correctly but is not supported by Google's Android NDK. This is also the real reason why XBMC for Android does not support the original
  
   Google TV
  
  , since the Android NDK was not made available for older Google TV devices it means that Kodi/XBMC could not be compiled for it today.
  

    [73]
   


  XBMC 9.04 (codename:
  
   Babylon
  
  ) point-release version of XBMC for Xbox, now obsolete, was released on 6 May 2009 as the last official version of XBMC for Xbox. The original developers of XBMC have since issued a statement stating they will no longer develop or support XBMC for Xbox as part of the XBMC project as of 27 May 2010. The development of XBMC for Xbox ended because the focus for all Team XBMC developers has completely shifted to the Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of XBMC instead.
 
  Even though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, an XBMC version for the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project "
  
   XBMC4Xbox
  
  ", who have completely taken over the development and support of XBMC for the original Xbox.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   



    [26]
   



    [27]
   


  XBMC for Xbox was never an authorized/signed Microsoft product, therefore a
  
   modification of the Xbox
  
  is required in order to run XBMC on an Xbox game-console. XBMC for Xbox can be run as an application (like any Xbox game), or as a
  
   dashboard
  
  that appears directly when the Xbox is turned on.
  

    [5]
   



    [8]
   



    [9]
   



    [18]
   

  Since XBMC for Xbox was part of an open source software program, its development
  
   source code
  
  was stored on a publicly accessible
  
   subversion repository
  
  . Accordingly, unofficial
  
   executable
  
  builds from the subversion repository are often released by third parties on sites unaffiliated with the official XBMC project.
  

    [5]
   



    [9]
   


  The developers of Kodi (formerly
  
   XBMC
  
  ) state that as long as the GPL licensing of the Kodi software is respected they would love Kodi to run on as many third-party hardware platforms and
  
   operating systems
  
  as possible, as "
  

    Powered by Kodi
   

  " (or "
  

    Powered by XBMC
   

  ") branded devices and systems. They envision Kodi being pre-installed as a
  
   third-party software component
  
  that commercial and non-commercial
  
   ODM
  
  /
  
   OEM
  
  's and
  
   systems integrator
  
  companies can use
  
   royalty-free
  
  on their own hardware, hardware such as
  
   set-top boxes
  
  from
  
   cable-TV companies
  
  ,
  
   Blu-ray Disc
  
  and
  
   DVD players
  
  ,
  
   game-consoles
  
  , or
  
   embedded computers
  
  and
  
   SoC (System-on-a-Chip)
  
  built into
  
   television sets
  
  for web-enabled TVs, and other entertainment devices for the living room entertainment system,
  
   home cinema
  
  , or similar uses.

  Below is a list of third-party companies who sell hardware bundled with Kodi or XBMC software pre-install, or sell uninstalled systems that specifically claim to be Kodi- or XBMC-compatible. Many of these third-party companies help submit bug fixes and new features back upstream to the original Kodi/XBMC project.

  Kodi/XBMC media center source code have over the years become a popular software to
  
   fork
  
  and to use as an
  
   application framework platform
  
  for others to base their own media player or media center software on, as if Kodi were a
  
   GUI toolkit
  
  ,
  
   windowing system
  
  , or
  
   window manager
  
  . And today at least
  
   Boxee
  
  ,
  
   Plex
  
  ,
  
   Tofu
  
  ,
  
   MediaPortal
  
  ,
  
   OpenELEC

   GeeXboX
  
  ,
  
   Voddler
  
  ,
  
   DVDFab Media Player
  
  , and
  
   Horizon TV
  
  are all separate derivative products that are all openly known to at least initially have forked the
  
   GUI (Graphical User Interface)
  
  and media player part of their software from XBMC's source code. Many of these third-party forks and derivative work of Kodi/XBMC are said to still assist with submitting bug fixes
  
   upstream
  
  and sometimes help getting new features
  
   backported
  
  to the original Kodi/XBMC project so that others can utilize it as well, shared from one main source.
  

    [12]
   



    [16]
   



    [97]
   

  However some which was initially a fork of XBMC have since fully or partially been rewritten to use
  
   closed source proprietary software
  
  .

  which are free and open source
  
   embedded operating systems
  
  providing complete media center software suite that comes with a pre-configured version of Kodi/XBMC and
  
   DVR/PVR
  
  plugins. They are both designed to be extremely small and very fast booting embedded
  
   Linux based
  
  distributions, primarily optimized to be booted from
  
   flash memory
  
  or a
  
   solid-state drive

  Another example is
  
   XBMC4Xbox
  
  , which is a third-party developer spin-off project of XBMC, with still active development and support of the Xbox platform. This project was created as a fork of XBMC as a separate project to continue having a version of XBMC for the Xbox hardware platform. It was not started by official members of the official XBMC project, nor will it be supported by the official Team Kodi in any way. It started when support for the Xbox branch was officially dropped by Team XBMC, which was announced on 27 May 2010.

  Kodi is a non-profit and
  
   free software community
  
  driven
  
   open-source software
  
  project that is developed only by volunteers in their
  
   spare time
  
  without any
  
   monetary
  
  gain. XBMC Foundation and the team of developers leading the development of Kodi/XBMC, "
  
   Team-Kodi
  
  "/"
  
   Team-XBMC
  
  ", encourage anyone and everyone to submit their own
  
   source code patches
  
  for new features and functions, improve existing ones, or fix
  
   bugs
  
  to the Kodi/XBMC project.
 
  The online
  
   user manual
  
  is
  
   wiki
  
  -based and community driven, and it also works as a basic developers guide for getting a good overview of Kodi's architecture. However, as with most non-profit software projects, to delve deeper into programming, looking at the actual source code and the
  
   Doxygen
  
  formatted "code documentation" comments inside that code is needed.
  

    [5]
   


  Kodi is a cross-platform software application whose core is mainly programmed in
  

    C++
   

  . Kodi uses
  
   OpenGL
  
  (or
  
   OpenGL ES
  
  ) graphics
  
   rendering
  
  under Kodi for both Linux and macOS, while Kodi for Windows uses
  
   Microsoft DirectX
  
  multimedia framework and
  
   Direct3D
  
  rendering, as the
  
   Xbox
  
  version of XBMC did. Some of Kodi's own
  
   libraries
  
  , as well as many third-party libraries that Kodi depends on, are written in the
  
   C programming-language
  
  , instead of
  
   C++
  
  as Kodi's core, but they are then mostly used with a
  
   C++
  
  wrapper and, through Kodi's core monolithic nature, are loaded via a
  
   dynamic linker
  

   loader
  
  for on-demand loading and unloading at
  
   run time
  
  .
  

    [13]
   



    [28]
   

  Kodi also still partially uses the SDL (
  
   Simple DirectMedia Layer
  
  ) multimedia
  
   framework
  
  for input on Linux, but its developers are working on completely removing that small remaining dependency on SDL.
  

    [119]
   


  Because of Kodi/XBMC's origin with the resource constraints on the hardware and environment of the first-generation Xbox game-console platform, all software development of Kodi/XBMC has always been focused on reserving the limited resources that existed on embedded system hardware, like the original Xbox (which was only a 733 MHz
  
   Intel Pentium III
  
  and 64 MB of RAM in total as
  
   shared memory
  
  ), as well as the still relatively low resources of
  
   embedded system
  
  devices today, of which the main hindrance has always been the amount of available system
  
   RAM
  
  and graphics memory at any one time. Due to this it means that Kodi/XBMC is purposely programmed to be very resource and power efficient and can therefore run on very low-end and relatively non-expensive hardware, especially when compared to other media center software design for HTPC use.
  

    [5]
   


  But because of its origins from the Xbox game-console, Kodi/XBMC's legacy
  
   graphics renderer
  
  still runs in a more game-loop rendering environment rather than using a fully event-driven and on-demand rendering, meaning that it is almost constantly re-drawing the GUI and refreshing the frames as fast as it can, even when nothing is changing on the screen. This results in very high CPU and high GPU usage, which can be observed on embedded systems and low-end machines, and hence cause high temperatures, high fan activity, and high power consumption unless capped at a maximum frame per second configuration for that specific platform build. Work is however constantly ongoing by the developers to make Kodi/XBMC run using much fewer resources on low-power and embedded systems, which will indirectly benefit all non-embedded systems as well.
  

    [28]
   

  Efficiency improvements in this area are however being worked on in order to move away from that old style game-loop environment in order to reduce high CPU/GPU usage by the GUI, especially as XBMC usage on embedded platforms with limited CPU/GPU resources keeps growing in popularity. XBMC 11.0 (Eden) introduced Dirty-Regions rendering option for texture support to the XBMC skinning engine as an option,
  

    [120]
   

  and XBMC 12.0 (Frodo) enabled Dirty Regions rendering to redraw the whole screen on a single dirty region by default on all platforms.
  

    [120]
   



    [121]
   

  Work is also in progress for XBMC 14.0 to introduce an abstracted scene-graph deferred rendering for GUI renderer abstraction.
  

    [122]
   


  Kodi has a
  
   portable code base
  
  , with its
  
   trunk (mainline source code tree)
  
  officially available for
  
   IA-32
  
  /
  
   x86
  
  ,
  
   x86-64
  
  ,
  
   PowerPC
  
  , and
  
   ARM
  
  -based platforms.
  

    [123]
   



    [124]
   

  The Kodi GUI does require 3D hardware accelerated graphics (
  
   GPU
  
  ) that support
  
   OpenGL ES
  
  ,
  
   OpenGL
  
  , or
  
   EGL
  
  , or
  
   Direct3D
  
  with device drivers that support
  
   OpenGL ES
  
  2.0, or OpenGL 1.3 or later with
  
   GLSL
  
  , or
  
   DirectX
  
  in order to
  
   render
  
  the GUI at an acceptable
  
   frame rate
  
  .
 
  Kodi is thus officially not yet available for
  
   MIPS
  
  upstream in mainline source code repository from Team-Kodi,
  

    [125]
   

  nor does it as yet support
  
   DirectFB
  


    [126]
   

  or
  
   DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure)
  
  rendering without OpenGL/GLES hardware accelerated graphics support.
  

    [28]
   



    [126]
   



    [127]
   

  The combination of MIPS, DirectFB, and DRI is a popular architecture used today by simpler
  
   set-top boxes
  
  like digital broadcasting (cable/satellite) boxes and low-end
  
   digital media players
  
  , such as those based on
  
   MIPS architecture
  
  chipsets from
  
   Sigma Designs
  
  or
  
   Realtek
  
  .
  

    [128]
   

  Kodi ports to MIPS is, however, currently being actively worked on by several independent development teams.
  

    [125]
   


  Kodi for Linux supports
  
   toolchain
  
  building systems for embedded development such as
  
   Yocto
  
  ,
  
   Buildroot
  
  (
  
   uClibc
  
  ), and the
  
   Linaro
  
  set of Makefiles and patches for easing the generation of
  
   cross-compilation
  
  toolchains as well as the creation of a file system on
  
   embedded Linux
  
  systems across a wide range of hardware, kernel platforms, and CPU architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.).
 
  Kodi allows developers to create addons using a built-in
  
   Python interpreter
  
  (version 2.6 or higher depending on system
  

    [129]
   

  ) and its own WindowXML
  
   application framework
  
  , which together form an XML-based widget toolkit for which they can extend the capability of Kodi by creating a
  
   GUI
  
  for
  
   widgets
  
  . Python
  
   widget
  
  scripts allow non-developers to themselves create new add-ons for Kodi, using Python.
  

    [13]
   


  Other than the
  
   application programming interfaces
  
  (APIs) available to third-party Python scripts and addon plugins, Kodi features several other APIs for controlling Kodi remotely or from an external application. These APIs includes a
  
   JSON-RPC
  
  server,
  
   D-Bus Server
  
  ,
  
   Web server
  
  ,
  
   UPnP AV media server
  
  (with UPnP MediaServer ControlPoint, UPnP MediaRenderer DCP, UPnP RenderingControl DCP, and UPnP Remote User Interface server), and a custom multi-protocol Event Server
  

    [51]
   

  for remote controls.
 
  Kodi/XBMC is noted as having a very flexible
  
   GUI toolkit
  
  and robust
  
   framework
  
  for its
  
   GUI
  
  . With its underlying complex
  
   graphical design and layout
  

   library
  
  (named libGUI in Kodi/XBMC), it provides a simple
  
   abstraction layer
  
  between the application code and the interface, while allowing extremely flexible dynamic layouts and animations that are easy to work with and makes it possible to create completely unique
  
   skins
  
  for XBMC.
  

    [38]
   

  The skin files are written in
  
   XAML
  
  , using a standard
  
   XML
  
  base, making
  
   theme
  
  -
  
   skinning
  
  and personal customization very accessible.

  This is a list of software limitations in the Kodi/XBMC source code:
 
  XBMC won a
  
   Lifehacker Awards
  
  in 2014 for "Best Media Player" in their entertainment selection.
  

    [130]
   

  XBMC won two
  
   SourceForge
  
  2006 Community Choice Awards.
  

    [131]
   

  In the 2007 Community Choice Awards, XBMC was nominated finalist in six categories.
  

    [132]
   

  Also in the 2008 Community Choice Awards XBMC won an award for Best Project for Gamers.
  

    [133]
   

  With
  
   Microsoft's
  
  decision to discontinue Windows Media Center (WMC) starting Windows 10, htpcBeginner.com voted Kodi not only as the best WMC alternative but also in many ways better than WMC.
  

    [134]
   


  Xbox Media Center (XBMC) was the successor to the popular Xbox Media Player (XBMP) software. Xbox Media Player development stopped on 13 December 2003, by which time its successor was ready for its debut, renamed as it was growing out of its 'player' name and into a 'center' for media playback. The first stable release of XBMC was on 29 June 2004, with the official release of XboxMediaCenter 1.0.0. This announcement also encouraged everyone using XBMP or XBMC Beta release to update, as all support for those previous versions would be dropped, and they would only support version 1.0.0. Not featured in XBMP, the addition of embedded
  
   Python
  
  was given the ability to draw interface elements in the GUI, and allowed user and community generated scripts to be executed within the XBMC environment.
  

    [5]
   


  With the release of 1.0.0 in the middle of 2004, work continued on the XBMC project to add more features, such as support for iTunes features like DAAP and Smart Playlists, as well as lots of improvements and fixes. The second stable release of XBMC, 1.1.0, was released on 18 October 2004. This release included support for more media types, file types, container formats, as well as video playback of Nullsoft streaming videos and karaoke support (CD-G).
  

    [5]
   


  After two years of heavy development, XBMC announced a stable point final release of XBMC 2.0.0 on 29 September 2006. Even more features were packed into the new version with the addition of RAR and zip archive support, a brand new player interface with support for multiple players. Such players include PAPlayer, the new audio/music player with crossfade, gapless playback and ReplayGain support, and the new DVDPlayer with support for menu and navigation support as well as ISO/img image parsing. Prior to this point release, XBMC just used a modified fork of
  
   MPlayer
  
  for all of its media needs, so this was a big step forward. Support for iTunes 6.x DAAP, and Upnp Clients for streaming was also added. A reworked Skinning Engine was included in this release to provide a more powerful way to change the appearance of XBMC. The last two features include read-only support for FAT12/16/32 formatted
  
   USB Mass Storage
  
  devices, and a "skinnable" 3D visualizer.
 
  The release of XBMC 2.0.1 on 12 November 2006 contained numerous fixes for bugs that made it through the 2.0.0 release. This also marked the change from CVS to SVN (Subversion) for the development tree.
 
  On 29 May 2007, the team behind XBMC put out a call for developers interested in porting XBMC to the Linux operating system. Since a few developers on Team-XBMC had already begun porting parts of XBMC over to Linux using SDL and OpenGL as a replacement for DirectX, which XBMC was using heavily on the Xbox version of XBMC.
  

    [135]
   



    [136]
   


  Development on the Git codebase is continuing and the versioning scheme has been changed to reflect the release year and month, e.g., 8.10, 9.04, 9.11, 10.05.
 
  On 27 May 2010, the team behind XBMC announced the splitting of the Xbox branch into a new project; "XBMC4Xbox" which will continue the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox hardware platform as a separate project, with the original XBMC project no longer offering any support for the Xbox.

  On 2 January 2011, XBMC moved the source code repository from
  
   subversion
  
  to
  
   git
  
  , hosted at
  
   GitHub
  
  .
  

    [137]
   


  On 1 August 2014, an announcement was made of release 14 and name change to Kodi.
  

    [138]
   


  This is a release history with condensed change-log lists for the most important added or removed notable new features, functions, and changed in each stable version of Kodi/XBMC.

  The XBMC Foundation is the organization behind the Kodi and XBMC projects. It is legally represented by the
  
   Software Freedom Law Center
  
  (SFLC), which assists the Kodi/XBMC project and its developers in legal matters such as
  
   copyright
  
  , trademark, and branding questions. It also assists with economic issues such as handling donations and sponsors that help the project with expenses for
  
   dedicated hosting service
  
  and activities such as going to developer conferences, trade fairs and computer expos to tech demo Kodi, meeting with potential new developers, and gain publicity to attract additional users.

  Kodi's source code for all its supported platforms is made publicly available by Team Kodi under the
  
   open source
  

   GNU General Public License Version 2
  
  license. The group maintains a
  
   Git
  
  repository for this source code. The XBMC Foundation and Team-Kodi developers take no position as to whether any intellectual property rights exist in the Kodi core source code, the third-party code libraries it depends upon, or any add-ons or plugins developed for Kodi. As such, Kodi is provided
  
   as is
  
  from the kodi.tv website and other official XBMC Foundation channels and affiliates.
 
  Third-party add-ons allow users to stream copyrighted content without the permission of its copyright holder. Some Kodi distributions and hardware devices, often marketed as "fully loaded",
  

    [160]
   

  are pre-loaded with the software and such add-ons.
  

    [161]
   



    [162]
   

  As a result, some users have incorrectly associated these products and add-ons as being affiliated with the Kodi project.
  

    [163]
   



    [17]
   

  In June 2015,
  
   Amazon Appstore
  
  pulled Kodi, as it can be "used to facilitate the piracy or illegal download of content", even though the software is not bundled with such content. XBMC Foundation president Nathan Betzen disagreed with the assumption, stating that "We always say we don't care what our users do with the software, and we stand by that position. But we sure do hate it when companies destroy the name of our software in order to make a profit." He also considered it ironic that Amazon would ban the app, given that it, in his opinion, helped to
  
   bolster the popularity
  
  of Amazon Fire TV products. It was also pointed out that Amazon still distributed Kodi distributions with infringing add-ons via the same storefront.
  

    [17]
   



    [164]
   



    [165]
   

  Over the 2015 holiday shopping season, the
  
   Amazon Fire TV Stick
  
  experienced a stock shortage in the United Kingdom that was speculated to have been associated with its use with Kodi.
  

    [162]
   



    [17]
   


  In February 2016, the XBMC Foundation reiterated its stance on third-party Kodi products meant for the streaming of unlicensed content; Betzen explained that the reputation of the Kodi project had been hurt by its association with third-party products whose sellers "make a quick buck modifying Kodi, installing broken piracy add-ons, advertising that Kodi lets you watch free movies and TV, and then vanishing when the user buys the box and finds out that the add-on they were sold on was a crummy, constantly breaking mess." Betzen warned that although it is open source software, the name "Kodi" and its logos are
  
   registered trademarks
  
  of the XBMC Foundation, and that the foundation intended to strictly enforce its trademark rights to prevent their unauthorized use, especially in association with information and devices meant to enable access to unlicensed content.
  

    [163]
   



    [17]
   


  In April 2017, following an
  
   April Fools' Day
  
  joke where the Kodi website was taken down and replaced with a fake government takedown notice, Kodi's developers stated that they were considering working with legal third-party content providers to officially support their services within Kodi (including supporting
  
   digital rights management
  
  ) to counter the perception that the software is primarily used for piracy.
