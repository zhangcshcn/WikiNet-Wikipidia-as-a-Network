  Michael Dell was born in 1965 in
  
   Houston
  
  , to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish
  
   Thal
  
  ("valley" or "dale [
  
   q.v.
  
  ]"; modern common-noun spelling
  
   Tal
  
  ) upon the family's immigration to the United States.
  

    [9]
   

  The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a
  
   stockbroker
  
  ,
  

    [10]
   

  and Alexander Dell, an
  
   orthodontist
  
  , Michael Dell attended
  
   Herod Elementary School
  
  in
  
   Houston
  
  .
  

    [11]
   

  In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a
  
   high school equivalency exam
  
  at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his
  
   earnings
  
  from part-time jobs in
  
   stocks
  
  and
  
   precious metals
  
  .
  

    [12]
   


  Dell purchased his first
  
   calculator
  
  at age seven and encountered an early
  
   teletype
  
  terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at
  
   Radio Shack
  
  , he got his first computer, an
  
   Apple II
  
  , which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.
  

    [13]
   

  He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to
  
   maitre d'
  
  .
  

    [14]
   

  Dell attended
  
   Memorial High School
  
  in Houston, selling subscriptions to the
  

    Houston Post
   

  in the summer. While making
  
   cold calls
  
  , he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.
  

    [15]
   


  While a pre-med student at the
  
   University of Texas
  
  , Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers
  

    [16]
   

  in Room 2713 of the
  
   Dobie Center
  
  residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.

  In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a
  
   manufacturer selling
  
  PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a
  
   condominium
  
  , the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's
  
   capitalization cost
  
  was $1,000.
  

    [20]
   



    [21]
   


  In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in
  

    Fortune
   

  magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.
  

    [22]
   

  In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first
  
   servers
  
  . Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.
  

    [23]
   

  In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing
  
   Compaq
  
  to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.
  

    [24]
   


  In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.
  

    [25]
   

  On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while
  
   Kevin Rollins
  
  , then president and
  
   COO
  
  , became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.

   Silver Lake Partners

   Michael and Susan Dell Foundation
  
  , which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.

  , a timeline of Michael Dell's life is detailed in "Michael Dell: The Making of an American Oligarch: How a homegrown geek outsourced, downsized, and tax-breaked his way to the top." The article juxtaposes Dell's spending on luxurious homes and private jet travel with his pursuit of
  
   tax breaks
  
  and
  
   tax holidays
  
  and
  
   Dell Computer
  
  's eventual
  
   offshoring
  
  of jobs overseas after receiving the incentives for setting up shop locally.
