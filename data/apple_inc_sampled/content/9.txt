  is a trade show with conference tracks dedicated to the
  
   Apple
  

   Macintosh
  
  platform. It is held annually in the
  
   United States
  
  during January. Originally
  
   Macworld Expo
  
  and then
  
   Macworld Conference & Exposition
  
  , the gathering dates back to 1985.
 


    Macworld
   

  is the most widely read Macintosh
  
   magazine
  
  in
  
   North America
  
  and a
  
   trademark
  
  of
  
   Mac Publishing
  
  , a wholly owned subsidiary of
  
   International Data Group
  
  . IDG World Expo is also a subsidiary.
 
  The conference tracks are taught by leaders in their fields and require large admission fees. They last for a few more days than the Expo, which runs generally three or four days. Attendees can visit the exhibits, set up by hardware manufacturers and software publishers that support the Macintosh platform.
 
  On December 18, 2008, Apple announced that the 2009 Macworld Conference & Expo would be the last in which the company participates.

  The first Macworld Expo occurred in 1985 in
  
   San Francisco
  
  . The conference itself was created by Peggy Kilburn,
  

    [7]
   

  who helped to increase the size and profit of the event during her tenure (1985â€“1999). Among the speakers recruited by Kilburn were
  
   David Pogue
  
  ,
  
   Steve Case
  
  ,
  
   Bob LeVitus
  
  , as well as representatives from
  
   BMUG
  
  ,
  
   LaserBoard
  
  , and other major user groups.
 
  The San Francisco event has always been held at the
  
   Moscone Center
  
  . The Expo was also held in Brooks Hall near the San Francisco Civic Center from 1985 until 1993, when the expansion of Moscone Center allowed the show to be consolidated in one location.
 
  Until 2005, the
  
   U.S.
  
  shows were held semiannually, with a January show in San Francisco and an additional summer show held in the Eastern US. The later event was held initially in
  
   Boston
  
  at the Bayside Expo & Executive Conference Center, later expanding with a dual presence at the
  
   World Trade Center Boston
  
  . From 1998 to 2003 it took place in
  
   New York City
  
  's
  
   Jacob K. Javits Convention Center
  
  . The 2004 and 2005 summer shows, retitled
  
   Macworld Conference & Expo
  
  took place in Boston, although without Apple's participation. Other companies followed Apple's lead, canceling or reducing the size of their own exhibits, which resulted in reduced attendance compared with previous Macworld conferences. On 16 September 2005, IDG announced that no further summertime shows would be held in NYC or in Boston.

  The show has also taken place in other cities:
 
  Since 1997, the show has been known for its keynote presentations (sometimes called "
  
   Stevenotes
  
  ") by
  
   Apple
  

   CEO
  

   Steve Jobs
  
  .
 
  In Boston,
  
   Steve Jobs

   Apple Inc.
  
  Steve was the Chairman and CEO of

Apple's sales were $11.1 billion in 1995, $9.5 billion in 1996, and $7 billion in 1997. Steve stated the falling sales were the fundamental problem. The beginning steps that Apple was going to take were: Board of Directors, Focus on Relevance, Invest in Core Assets, Meaningful Partnerships, and New Product Paradigm. Steve announced the new Board of Directors: Ed Woolard, Chairman and former CEO of
  
   DuPont
  
  ; Gareth Chang, President of Hughes International;

   Chrysler
  
  ;
  
   William Campbell (business executive)
  
  , CEO of
  
   Intuit
  
  , and Steve Jobs himself. Steve addressed their market focus. Apple was the dominant market leader for creative professionals. 80% of all computers used in advertising, graphic design, prepress, and printing were Apple computers. 64% of internet websites were created on a
  
   Macintosh
  
  . Apple was the largest education company in the world. Apple sold 60% of all computers in education. They sold over $2 billion in annual revenues. Steve said the Apple's core assets were the Apple brand and

   Mac OS 8
  
  two weeks prior and had already sold 1,200,000 copies. Steve announced the partnership with

   Internet Explorer for Mac
  
  would be the default browser on Macintosh. Apple would be collaborating with Microsoft on
  
   Java (programming language)

   Mac OS X
  
  . The goals for Mac OS X were: to have a single OS strategy, state of the art plumbing, killer graphics,designed for the internet, and a gentle migration. There would be a 12-month rollout. The final beta would come out in Spring 2000. Mac OS X would go on-sale in Summer 2000. Apple would be pre-loading it on all machines in January 2001. Steve went through the architecture of Mac OS X. It started out with
  
   Darwin (operating system)
  
  , a super modern kernel. The next layer on top of Darwin was killer graphics. There were three components: 2D, which was
  
   Quartz (graphics layer)
  
  ; 3D, which was
  
   OpenGL
  
  ; and media layer, which was
  
   QuickTime
  
  . The next layer was
  
   APIs
  
  . These were
  
   Classic Environment
  
  ,
  
   Carbon (API)
  
  , and
  
   Cocoa (API)
  
  . One more thing, the completely new user interface. Steve demoed
  
   Aqua (user interface)
  
  . Steve demoed the different graphic layers. Steve brought
  
   Phil Schiller
  
  on stage to demo OpenGL graphics. Steve demoed the
  
   Dock
  
  . Mac OS X had over 100 developed already committed. Steve introduced

  During the Expo's first two decades, it became legendary for the parties that coincided with it, frequently with open bars, lavish
  
   hors d'oeuvres
  
  , and requisite
  
   T-shirts
  
  and other premium favors. Apple's developer parties featured high-profile entertainers like
  
   James Brown
  
  and
  
   Smash Mouth
  
  .
 
  Several years after the start of the Expo,
  

    MacWEEK
   

  had launched its weekly trade magazine and simultaneously initiated an exclusive party known as
  
   Mac the Knife
  
  , named for its anonymous columnist that wrote the back page industry gossip and rumor section; after
  
   MacWEEK
  

   '
  
  s demise, the party was thrown by
  
   Ilene Hoffman
  
  , until
  
   Mac Publishing
  
  , owners of the Mac the Knife trademark, forbade her from using the name. The party continued, with appearances by the
  
   Macworld All-Star Band
  
  , under a series of names that referenced the Knife.
 

   Robert Hess
  
  of
  
   MacWEEK
  
  was the original keeper of the Macworld Party List, which kept track of each leisure event after the show. Prior to his death in 1996, he reportedly requested Hoffman to maintain it; the list was subsequently renamed the Robert Hess Memorial Events List. The list shrunk gradually as events became more sparse, and did not publish for the show in New York 2003, but has been published for subsequent San Francisco shows.
