   Santa Clara County, California
  
  , officially the
  
   County of Santa Clara
  
  , is a
  
   county
  
  in the
  
   U.S. state
  
  of
  
   California
  
  . As of the
  
   2010 census
  
  , the population was 1,781,642.
  

    [3]
   

  The county seat is
  
   San Jose
  
  ,
  

    [4]
   

  the
  
   tenth-most populous city
  
  in the United States.
 
  Santa Clara County is part of the San Jose-
  
   Sunnyvale
  
  -
  
   Santa Clara
  
  , CA
  
   Metropolitan Statistical Area
  
  as well as the San Jose-
  
   San Francisco
  
  -
  
   Oakland
  
  , CA
  
   Combined Statistical Area
  
  . Located at the southern end of the
  
   San Francisco Bay
  
  , the highly urbanized
  
   Santa Clara Valley
  
  within Santa Clara County is also known as
  
   Silicon Valley
  
  . Santa Clara is the most populous county in the
  
   San Francisco Bay Area
  
  region, and one of the most
  
   affluent counties
  
  in the United States.
 
  Santa Clara County is named after
  
   Mission Santa Clara
  
  , which was established in 1777, and is also named for
  
   Saint Clare of Assisi
  
  .
 
  Santa Clara County was one of the original counties of California, formed in 1850 at the time of statehood. The original inhabitants included the
  
   Ohlone
  
  , residing on
  
   Coyote Creek
  
  and
  
   Calaveras Creek
  
  . Part of the county's territory was given to
  
   Alameda County
  
  in 1853.
 
  In 1882, Santa Clara County tried to levy taxes upon property of the
  
   Southern Pacific Railroad
  
  within county boundaries. The result was the
  
   U.S. Supreme Court
  
  case of
  

    Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad
   

  ,
  
   118 U.S. 394
  
  (1886), in which the Court extended Due Process rights to
  
   artificial legal entities
  
  .
 
  In the early 20th Century, the area was promoted as the "Valley of the Heart's Delight" due to its natural beauty, including a significant number of orchards.
  

    [5]
   


  The first major technology company to be based in the area was
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  , founded in a garage in Palo Alto in 1939.
  
   IBM
  
  selected San Jose as its West Coast headquarters in 1943.
  
   Varian Associates
  
  ,
  
   Fairchild Semiconductor
  
  , and other early innovators were located in the county by the late 1940s and 1950s. The U.S. Navy had a large presence in the area and began giving large contracts to Silicon Valley electronics companies. The term "
  
   Silicon Valley
  
  " was coined in 1971. The trend accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, and agriculture has since then been nearly eliminated from the northern part of the county. Today, Santa Clara County is the headquarters for approximately 6500 high technology companies, including many of the largest tech companies in the world, among them hardware manufacturers
  
   AMD
  
  ,
  
   Cisco Systems
  
  and
  
   Intel
  
  , computer and consumer electronics companies
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  and Hewlett-Packard, and internet companies
  
   eBay
  
  ,
  
   Facebook
  
  ,
  
   Google
  
  and
  
   Yahoo!
  
  . Most of what is considered to be Silicon Valley is located within the county, although some adjoining tech regions in
  
   San Mateo
  
  , Alameda, and
  
   Santa Cruz
  
  counties are also considered a part of Silicon Valley.
 
  According to the
  
   U.S. Census Bureau
  
  , the county has a total area of 1,304 square miles (3,380 km
  
   2
  
  ), of which 1,290 square miles (3,300 km
  
   2
  
  ) is land and 14 square miles (36 km
  
   2
  
  ) (1.1%) is water.
  

    [6]
   


  The
  
   San Andreas Fault
  
  runs along the
  
   Santa Cruz Mountains
  
  in the south and west of the county.
 
  In 1978,
  
   California Department of Fish and Game
  
  warden Henry Coletto urged the department to choose the
  
   Mount Hamilton
  
  area as one of California's relocation sites under a new statewide effort to restore
  
   tule elk
  
  (
  
   Cervus canadensis ssp. nannodes
  
  ). While other ranchers refused, tech pioneers
  
   Bill Hewlett
  
  and
  
   David Packard
  
  allowed Coletto and state biologists to translocate 32 tule elk from the
  
   Owens Valley
  
  in the eastern
  
   Sierra
  
  onto the 28,000-acre (11,000 ha)
  
   San Felipe Ranch
  
  , which the families jointly own, in the hills east of
  
   Morgan Hill
  
  .
  

    [7]
   

  From the three original 1978-1981 translocations to the Mount Hamilton region of the
  
   Diablo Range
  
  , there are multiple herds in different locations including the Isabel Valley, San Antonio Valley, Livermore area, San Felipe Ranch, Metcalf Canyon,
  
   Coyote Ridge
  
  ,
  
   Anderson Lake
  
  , and surrounding areas. As of 2012
  

    [update]
   

  , an estimated 400 tule elk roam 1,875 square kilometres (724 sq mi) in northeastern Santa Clara County and southeastern
  
   Alameda County
  
  .
  

    [8]
   



   The Nature Conservancy
  
  "Mount Hamilton Project" has acquired or put under conservation easement 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land towards its 500,000 acres (200,000 ha) goal for habitat conservation within a 1,200,000 acres (490,000 ha) area encompassing much of eastern Santa Clara County as well as portions of southern Alameda County, western
  
   Merced
  
  and
  
   Stanislaus Counties
  
  , and northern
  
   San Benito County
  
  . Acquisitions to date include the 1,756-acre (711 ha)
  
   Rancho Cañada de Pala
  
  , straddling the
  
   Alameda Creek
  
  and
  
   Coyote Creek
  
  watersheds for California tiger salamander habitat; a conservation easement on the 3,259-acre
  
   Blue Oak Ranch Reserve
  
  , which abuts the north side of
  
   Joseph D. Grant County Park
  
  ; a conservation easement on the 28,359-acre San Felipe Ranch, connecting Joseph D. Grant County Park with
  
   Henry W. Coe State Park
  
  ; the 2,899-acre South Valley Ranch which protects a tule elk herd in the San Antonio Valley, and other properties.

  As of 1980
  

    [update]
   

  , Santa Clara County has the highest number of
  
   Superfund Sites
  
  of any county in the United States, accounting for 25 polluted locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.
  

    [11]
   



    [12]
   

  The vast majority of these Superfund sites were caused by firms associated with the high tech sector located in

  Since 1992, Santa Clara County has been a strongly
  
   Democratic
  
  county in
  
   presidential
  
  and
  
   congressional
  
  elections. The last Republican to win a majority in the county was
  
   Ronald Reagan
  
  in
  
   1984
  
  . It was a bellwether county for much of the twentieth century. However, like the rest of the Bay Area, it swung heavily to the Democrats in the 1990s nationally. While Republicans remained competitive at the state and local level for the rest of the 1990s, there are currently no elected Republicans representing significant parts of the county above the county level.
 
  As of November 2012, all of the cities, towns, and the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County have more registered Democrats than Republicans.
  

    [36]
   

  In the
  
   2008 US Presidential Election
  
  , Democratic nominee
  
   Barack Obama
  
  carried every city and town in the county, as well as the unincorporated areas.

  Following the passage of
  
   Proposition 8
  
  , Santa Clara County joined
  
   San Francisco
  
  and
  
   Los Angeles
  
  in a
  
   lawsuit
  
  , becoming, along with San Francisco and Los Angeles, the first governmental entities in the world to sue for same-sex marriage.

  The following table includes the number of incidents reported and the rate per 1,000 persons for each type of offense.
 
  The county's economy is heavily service based. Technology, both hardware and software, dominates the service sector by value, but like any other county, Santa Clara has its share of retail and office support workers.
 
  The San Jose/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara metropolitan region, comprising Santa Clara County and San Benito County, was ranked as the highest performing metropolitan area in the US in 2012, ahead of
  
   Austin, Texas
  
  and
  
   Raleigh, North Carolina
  
  , according to the
  
   Milken Institute
  
  .
  

    [42]
   

  The GDP of the metro area reached $176.7 billion in 2011, or $94,587 per capita,
  

    [43]
   

  roughly on par with
  
   Qatar
  
  in both total GDP and per capita (nominal).
  

    [44]
   

  GDP grew a strong 7.7% in 2011, and in contrast with most of California, GDP and per capita GDP (nominal) is well above 2007 (financial crisis) levels. Despite relative wealth vis a vis other regions nationally, a large underclass exists whose income is roughly equivalent to that elsewhere in the country, despite extreme land prices. The surge in metro GDP is highly correlated with home prices, which for average single-family homes passed $1 million ($1,017,528) in August 2013.

   port of entry
  


    [47]
   

  and as of 2016 has eight international routes (one to Canada, one to England, one to Germany, one to Japan, two to Mexico, and two to China) but the airport's busiest routes are all to cities in the western United States.
  
   San Francisco International Airport
  
  (SFO) is also often used for commercial services by residents of Santa Clara County.
 

   Moffett Federal Airfield
  
  (NUQ), a former U.S.
  
   Naval Air Station
  
  , is used by the
  
   Air National Guard
  
  ,
  
   NASA
  
  ,
  
   Lockheed Martin
  
  ,
  
   Google
  
  , and by the
  
   San Jose Police
  
  and
  
   Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department
  
  as an air operations base.
  

    [48]
   

  There are also smaller general aviation airports in
  
   Palo Alto (PAO)
  
  ,
  
   San Jose (Reid-Hillview) (RHV)
  
  , and
  
   San Martin(E16)
  


   Santa Clara Station

   San Francisco Airport
  
  and
  
   San Francisco
  
  , the
  
   ACE
  
  system which provides services to
  
   Stockton
  
  , and
  
   Amtrak
  
  which provides service to
  
   Sacramento
  
  and
  
   Oakland
  
  . In the Future,
  
   BART
  
  will provide service to San Jose and Santa Clara.
 
  The
  
   Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
  
  operates the
  
   VTA light rail
  
  system.
 
  Santa Clara County has consolidated its transportation services into the
  
   Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
  
  , which operates a bus system.
 
  The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority is establishing a bicycle network throughout the county. Santa Clara County Bicycle network is part of the
  
   San Francisco Bay Area
  

   Regional Bikeway Network
  
  .
 
  The county has an extensive
  
   freeway
  
  system and a separate expressway system.
  
   Expressways
  
  in California are distinct from freeways; although access to adjoining properties is eliminated, at-grade intersections are allowed. However, unlike expressways virtually everywhere else in California, the Santa Clara County expressways were built, signed, and maintained as county roads; they are not maintained by
  
   Caltrans
  
  , although they are patrolled by the
  
   California Highway Patrol
  
  .
 
  There is also a large
  
   street
  
  network dominated by four- and six-lane arterials. Some of the newer boulevards (primarily in the West Valley) are divided with landscaped medians.
 
  The county has no commercial seaports, although small boats can access San Francisco Bay from several points. Like many other Bay Area counties, it is dependent upon the
  
   Port of Oakland
  
  for transport of ocean cargo.
 
  Santa Clara County has an extensive park system, much of it founded in the major park expansion of the late 1970s. Parks within the county include:
 
  Open space preserves include:
 
  Santa Clara County also contains Ulistac Natural Area, a volunteer maintained natural open space. Foreign and invasive species are removed when possible as native plants are introduced. Migratory birds and butterflies often use this area.
 
  To promote friendship and understanding and to build bridges with countries of origin for various ethnic populations in the county, the County of Santa Clara has created a Sister County Commission to coordinate the program. As of 2009, there are three
  
   sister counties
  
  :
