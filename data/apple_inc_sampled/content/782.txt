  The
  

    Motorola
   
   68000 series
  
  (also termed
  
   680x0
  
  ,
  
   m68000
  
  ,
  
   m68k
  
  , or
  
   68k
  
  ) is a family of
  
   32-bit
  

   complex instruction set computer
  
  (CISC)
  
   microprocessors
  
  . During the 1980s and early 1990s, they were popular in
  
   personal computers
  
  and
  
   workstations
  
  and were the primary competitors of
  
   Intel
  
  's
  
   x86
  
  microprocessors. They were most well known as the processors powering the early Apple
  
   Macintosh
  
  , the Commodore
  
   Amiga
  
  , the
  
   Sinclair QL
  
  , the
  
   Atari ST
  
  , the
  
   WeatherStar
  
  , the
  
   Sega Genesis
  
  (Mega Drive), and several others. Although no modern desktop computers are based on processors in the 68000 series, derivative processors are still widely used in
  
   embedded systems
  
  .
 
  Motorola ceased development of the 68000 series architecture in 1994, replacing it with the development of the
  
   PowerPC
  
  architecture, which they developed in conjunction with
  
   IBM
  
  and
  
   Apple Computer
  
  as part of the
  
   AIM alliance
  
  .

  The 68000 line of processors has been used in a variety of systems, from modern high-end
  
   Texas Instruments
  
  calculators (the
  
   TI-89
  
  ,
  
   TI-92
  
  , and
  
   Voyage 200
  
  lines) to all of the members of the
  
   Palm Pilot
  
  series that run Palm OS 1.x to 4.x (OS 5.x is
  
   ARM
  
  -based), and even
  
   radiation hardened
  
  versions in the critical control systems of the
  
   Space Shuttle
  
  . However, they became most well known as the processors powering
  
   desktop computers
  
  such as the Apple
  
   Macintosh
  
  , the Commodore
  
   Amiga
  
  , the
  
   Sinclair QL
  
  , the
  
   Atari ST
  
  , and several others. The 68000 was also the processor of choice in the 1980s for
  
   Unix
  

   workstations
  
  and
  
   servers
  
  from firms such as
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  ,
  
   NeXT
  
  and
  
   Silicon Graphics
  
  (SGI). There was a 68000 version of
  
   CP/M
  
  called CP/M-68K, which was initially proposed to be the Atari ST operating system, but Atari chose
  
   Atari TOS
  
  instead.
 
  Also, and perhaps most significantly, the first several versions of Adobe's PostScript interpreters were 68000-based. The 68000 in the Apple
  
   LaserWriter
  
  and LaserWriter Plus was clocked faster than the version used then in Macintosh computers. A fast 68030 in later PostScript interpreters, including the standard resolution LaserWriter IIntx, IIf and IIg (also 300 dpi), the higher resolution LaserWriter Pro 600 series (usually 600 dpi, but limited to 300 dpi with minimum RAM installed) and the very high resolution
  
   Linotronic
  
  imagesetters, the 200PS (1500+ dpi) and 300PS (2500+ dpi). Thereafter, Adobe generally preferred a RISC for its processor, as its competitors, with their PostScript clones, had already gone with RISCs, often an AMD 29000-series. The early 68000-based Adobe PostScript interpreters and their hardware were named for
  
   cold war
  
  U.S. rockets and missiles: Atlas, Redstone, etc.
 
  Today, these systems are either end-of-line (in the case of the Atari), or are using different processors (in the case of Macintosh, Amiga, Sun, and SGI). Since these platforms had their marketshare peak in the 1980s, their original manufacturers are unlikely to support an operating system for this hardware or are even out of business. However, the GNU/
  
   Linux
  
  ,
  
   NetBSD
  
  and
  
   OpenBSD
  
  operating systems still include support for 68000 processors.
 
  The 68000 processors were also used in the
  
   Sega Genesis
  
  (Mega Drive) and
  
   SNK
  

   Neo Geo
  
  consoles as the main CPU. Other consoles such as the
  
   Sega Saturn
  
  used the 68000 for audio processing and other I/O tasks, while the
  
   Atari Jaguar
  
  included a 68000 which was intended for basic system control and input processing, but due to the Jaguar's unusual assortment of heterogeneous processors was also frequently used for running game logic. Many arcade boards also used 68000 processors including boards from Capcom, SNK, and Sega.
 

   Microcontrollers
  
  derived from the 68000 family have been used in a huge variety of applications. For example,
  
   CPU32
  
  and
  
   ColdFire
  
  microcontrollers have been manufactured in the millions as automotive engine controllers.
 
  People who are familiar with the
  
   PDP-11
  
  or
  
   VAX
  
  usually feel comfortable with the 68000. With the exception of the split of general purpose registers into specialized data and address registers, the 68000 architecture is in many ways a 32-bit PDP-11.
 
  It had a more
  
   orthogonal instruction set
  
  than those of many processors that came before (e.g., 8080) and after (e.g., x86). That is, it was typically possible to combine operations freely with operands, rather than being restricted to using certain addressing modes with certain instructions. This property made programming relatively easy for humans, and also made it easier to write code generators for compilers.
 
  The 68000
  
   instruction set
  
  can be divided in the following broad categories:
 
  There was no 68050, though at one point it was a project within Motorola. Odd-numbered releases had always been reactions to issues raised within the prior even numbered part; hence, it was generally expected that the 68050 would have reduced the 68040's power consumption (and thus heat dissipation), improved exception handling in the FPU, used a smaller feature size and optimized the microcode in line with program use of instructions. Many of these optimizations were included with the 68060 and were part of its design goals. For any number of reasons, likely that the 68060 was in development, that the Intel 80486 wasn't progressing as quickly as Motorola assumed it would, and that 68060 was a demanding project, the 68050 was cancelled early in development.
 
  There is also no revision of the
  
   68060
  
  , as Motorola was in the process of shifting away from the 68000 and
  
   88k
  
  processor lines into its new
  
   PowerPC
  
  business, so the 68070 was never developed. Had it been, it would have been a revised 68060, likely with a superior FPU (pipelining was widely speculated upon on Usenet).
 
  Motorola mainly used even numbers for major revisions to the CPU core such as 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060. The 68010 was a revised version of the 68000 with minor modifications to the core, and likewise the 68030 was a revised 68020 with some more powerful features, none of them significant enough to classify as a major upgrade to the core.
 
  There was a CPU with the
  
   68070
  
  designation, which was a licensed and somewhat slower version of the 16/32-bit 68000 with a basic DMA controller,
  
   I²C
  
  host and an on-chip serial port. This 68070 was used as the main CPU in the
  
   Philips
  

   CD-i
  
  . This CPU was, however, produced by
  
   Philips
  
  and not officially part of Motorola's 680x0 lineup.
 
  The 4th generation
  
   68060
  
  shared most of the features of the Intel
  
   P5 microarchitecture
  
  .
 
  The Personal Computers XT/370 and AT/370
  
   PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes
  
  each included two modified Motorola 68000 processors with custom
  
   microcode
  
  to emulate
  
   S/370
  
  mainframe instructions.

  After the mainline 68000 processors' demise, the 68000 family has been used to some extent in
  
   microcontroller
  
  and embedded microprocessor versions. These chips include the ones listed under "other" above, i.e. the CPU32 (aka
  
   68330
  
  ), the
  
   ColdFire
  
  , the
  
   QUICC
  
  and the
  
   DragonBall
  
  .
 
  During the 1980s and early 1990s, when the 68000 was widely used in desktop computers, it mainly competed against
  
   Intel
  
  's
  
   x86
  
  architecture used in
  
   IBM PC compatibles
  
  . Generation 1 68000 CPUs primarily competed against the
  
   16-bit
  

   8086
  
  ,
  
   8088
  
  , and
  
   80286
  
  . Generation 2 competed against the
  
   80386
  
  (the first 32-bit x86 processor), and generation 3 against the
  
   80486
  
  . The fourth generation competed with the
  
   P5
  

   Pentium
  
  line, but it was not nearly as widely used as its predecessors, since much of the old 68000 marketplace was either defunct or nearly so (as was the case with Atari and NeXT), or converting to newer architectures (
  
   PowerPC
  
  for the
  
   Macintosh
  
  and
  
   Amiga
  
  ,
  
   SPARC
  
  for
  
   Sun
  
  , and
  
   MIPS
  
  for
  
   Silicon Graphics
  
  (SGI)).
 
  There are dozens of processor architectures that are currently successful in
  
   embedded systems
  
  . Some are microcontrollers which are much simpler, smaller, and cheaper than the 68000, while others are relatively sophisticated and capable of running complex software. Embedded versions of the 68000 often compete with processors derived from the
  
   PowerPC
  
  ,
  
   ARM
  
  ,
  
   MIPS
  
  , and
  
   SuperH
  
  architectures, among others.
