   HTC One
  
  , had failed to generate impressive sales results.

  flagship handset and HTC recorded its first ever quarterly loss in early October 2013: a deficit of just under
  
   NT$
  
  3 billion (about US$100m, £62m). Marketing problems were identified by HTC as the primary reason for its comparative performance, a factor that had been previously cited by the company.
