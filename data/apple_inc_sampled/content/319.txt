  A
  
   mobile device
  
  (or
  
   handheld computer
  
  ) is a small
  
   computing device
  
  , typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an
  
   operating system
  
  capable of running
  
   mobile apps
  
  . These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a
  
   display screen
  
  with a small
  
   numeric
  
  or
  
   alphanumeric keyboard
  
  or a
  
   touchscreen
  
  providing a
  
   virtual keyboard
  
  and buttons (
  
   icons
  
  ) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the
  
   Internet
  
  and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or
  
   headsets
  
  via
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  ,
  
   Bluetooth
  
  or
  
   near field communication
  
  (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players,
  
   mobile phone
  
  and
  
   GPS
  
  capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a
  
   lithium battery
  
  .
 
  Early pocket-sized devices were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise similar
  
   tablet computers
  
  . Input and output is now usually via a
  
   touch-screen interface
  
  .
  
   Smartphones
  
  and
  
   personal digital assistants
  
  may provide much of the functionality of a laptop or desktop computer but more conveniently.
  
   Enterprise digital assistants
  
  can provide additional business functionality such as integrated data capture via
  
   barcode
  
  ,
  
   RFID
  
  and
  
   smart card
  
  readers By 2010, mobile devices often contained sensors such as
  
   accelerometers
  
  ,
  
   compasses
  
  ,
  
   magnetometers
  
  and
  
   gyroscopes
  
  allowing detection of orientation and motion. Mobile devices may provide
  
   biometric
  
  user authentication such as
  
   face recognition
  
  or
  
   fingerprint recognition
  
  .
 
  Manufacturers include
  
   Apple
  
  ,
  
   Samsung

   Sony

   HTC

  Device mobility can be viewed in the context of several dimensions:
  

    [1]
   


  Strictly speaking, many so-called mobile devices are not mobile. It is the host that is mobile, i.e., a mobile human host carries a non-mobile smart phone device. An example of a true mobile computing device, where the device itself is mobile, is a
  
   robot
  
  . Another example is an
  
   autonomous vehicle
  
  . There are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts: accompanied, surface-mounted or embedded into the fabric of a host, e.g., an embedded controller embedded in a host device. Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host, e.g., a mobile phone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced.
  

    [1]
   

  Hence, mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an
  
   autonomous vehicle
  
  can appear larger than pocket-sized.
 
  As stated earlier, the most common size of mobile computing device is pocket-sized that can be hand-held, but other sizes for mobile devices exist too.

  as the father of
  
   ubiquitous computing
  
  , computing everywhere, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, pad and board sized,
  

    [2]
   

  where
  
   tabs
  
  are defined as accompanied or wearable centimetre-sized devices, e.g.
  
   smartphones
  
  and
  
   smart cards
  
  , and
  
   pads
  
  are defined as hand-held decimetre-sized devices, e.g., laptops and tablet computers. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices.
  

    [1]
   


   Dust
  
  refers to miniaturised devices without direct HCI interfaces, e.g., micro electro-mechanical systems (
  
   MEMS
  
  ), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres. See also

   Skin
  
  : fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices. These can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains, see

  Although mobility is often regarded

  as synonymous with having wireless connectivity, these terms are different. Not all network access by mobile users, applications and devices need be via wireless networks and vice versa. Wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move in between wired and wireless hotspots such as in Internet caf√©s.
  

    [1]
   

  Some mobile devices can be used as
  
   mobile Internet devices
  
  to access the Internet while moving but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still operational even while disconnected to the
  
   Internet
  
  . What makes the mobile device unique compared to other technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and also the software. Flexible applications include video chat, Web browsing, payment systems, NFC, audio recording etc.
  

    [3]
   

  As mobile devices become ubiquitous there, will be a proliferation of services which include the use of the
  
   cloud
  
  .

  Although a common form of mobile device, a smartphone, has a display, another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device, the
  
   smart card
  
  , e.g., used as a bank card or travel card, does not have a display. This mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect, or be inserted into a reader in order to display its internal data or state.
 
  Mobile devices have been designed for many applications. They include:
 
  Handheld devices have become
  
   ruggedized
  
  for use in
  
   mobile field management
  
  . Uses include
  
   digitizing
  
  notes, sending and receiving
  
   invoices
  
  ,
  
   asset management
  
  , recording signatures, managing parts, and
  
   scanning barcodes
  
  . In 2009, developments in
  
   mobile collaboration
  
  systems enabled the use of handheld devices that combine video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities to enable multi-party
  
   conferencing
  
  in real-time, independent of location.

  Handheld computers are available in a variety of form factors, including
  
   smartphones
  
  on the low end, handheld
  
   PDAs
  
  ,
  
   Ultra-Mobile PCs
  
  and
  
   Tablet PCs

  Users can watch
  
   television through Internet by IPTV
  
  on some mobile devices. Mobile
  
   television receivers
  
  have existed since the 1960s, and in the 21st century mobile phone providers began making television available on cellular phones.

  In the 2010s, mobile devices can create,
  
   sync
  
  , and share everything we want despite of distance or specifications of mobile devices. In the medical field, mobile devices are quickly becoming essential tools for accessing clinical information such as drugs, treatment, even medical calculation.

  Due to the popularity of
  
   Candy Crush
  
  and other mobile device games, online casinos are also offering casino games on mobile devices. The casino games are available on
  
   iOS
  
  ,
  
   Android
  
  ,
  
   Windows Phone
  
  and
  
   Windows
  
  . Available games are
  
   roulette
  
  ,
  
   blackjack
  
  and several different types of
  
   slots
  
  . Most casinos have a play for free option.

  In the military, mobile devices have created new opportunities for the armed forces to deliver training and educational materials to soldiers, regardless of where they are stationed.
