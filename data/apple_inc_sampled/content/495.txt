  A
  
   computer network
  
  or
  
   data network
  
  is a
  
   telecommunications network
  
  which allows
  
   nodes
  
  to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a
  
   data link
  
  . The connections between nodes are established using either
  
   cable media
  
  or
  
   wireless media
  
  . The best-known computer network is the
  
   Internet
  
  .
 
  Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called
  
   network nodes
  
  .
  

    [1]
   

  Nodes can include
  
   hosts
  
  such as
  
   personal computers
  
  ,
  
   phones
  
  ,
  
   servers
  
  as well as
  
   networking hardware
  
  . Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other.
 
  Computer networks differ in the
  
   transmission medium
  
  used to carry their signals,
  
   communications protocols
  
  to organize network traffic, the network's size,
  
   topology
  
  and organizational intent.
 
  Computer networks support an enormous number of
  
   applications
  
  and
  
   services
  
  such as access to the
  
   World Wide Web
  
  ,
  
   digital video
  
  ,
  
   digital audio
  
  , shared use of
  
   application and storage servers
  
  ,
  
   printers
  
  , and
  
   fax machines
  
  , and use of
  
   email
  
  and
  
   instant messaging
  
  applications as well as many others. In most cases, application-specific communications protocols are
  
   layered
  
  (i.e. carried as
  
   payload
  
  ) over other more general communications protocols. This formidable collection of
  
   information technology
  
  requires skilled
  
   network management
  
  to keep it all
  
   running reliably
  
  .
 


  The chronology of significant computer-network developments includes:
 
  Computer networking may be considered a branch of
  
   electrical engineering
  
  ,
  
   telecommunications
  
  ,
  
   computer science
  
  ,
  
   information technology
  
  or
  
   computer engineering
  
  , since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.
 
  A computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, chat rooms, telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. Providing access to information on shared storage devices is an important feature of many networks. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer.
  
   Distributed computing
  
  uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks. A computer network may be used by
  
   computer crackers
  
  to deploy
  
   computer viruses
  
  or
  
   computer worms
  
  on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a
  
   denial of service
  
  attack.
 
  Computer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional
  
   point-to-point telecommunication links
  
  , simply transmit data as a
  
   bit stream
  
  . However, most information in computer networks is carried in
  
   packets
  
  . A network packet is a formatted unit of
  
   data
  
  (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a
  
   packet-switched network
  
  .
 
  In packet networks, the data is formatted into packets that are sent through the network to their destination. Once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original message. With packets, the
  
   bandwidth
  
  of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were
  
   circuit switched
  
  . When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused.
 
  Packets consist of two kinds of data: control information, and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example: source and destination
  
   network addresses
  
  ,
  
   error detection
  
  codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in
  
   packet headers
  
  and
  
   trailers
  
  , with
  
   payload data
  
  in between.
 
  Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case the packet is
  
   queued
  
  and waits until a link is free.
 
  The physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.
 
  The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the
  
   physical media
  
  ) used to link devices to form a computer network include
  
   electrical cable
  
  (
  
   Ethernet
  
  ,
  
   HomePNA
  
  ,
  
   power line communication
  
  ,
  
   G.hn
  
  ),
  
   optical fiber
  
  (
  
   fiber-optic communication
  
  ), and
  
   radio waves
  
  (
  
   wireless networking
  
  ). In the
  
   OSI model
  
  , these are defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer.
 
  A widely adopted
  
   family
  
  of transmission media used in local area network (
  
   LAN
  
  ) technology is collectively known as
  
   Ethernet
  
  . The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by
  
   IEEE 802.3
  
  . Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables. Wireless LAN standards (e.g. those defined by
  
   IEEE 802.11
  
  ) use
  
   radio waves
  
  , or others use
  
   infrared
  
  signals as a transmission medium.
  
   Power line communication
  
  uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.
 
  The orders of the following wired technologies are, roughly, from slowest to fastest transmission speed.
 
  Price is a main factor distinguishing wired- and wireless-technology options in a business. Wireless options command a price premium that can make purchasing wired computers, printers and other devices a financial benefit. Before making the decision to purchase hard-wired technology products, a review of the restrictions and limitations of the selections is necessary. Business and employee needs may override any cost considerations.
  

    [6]
   


  There have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media:
 
  Both cases have a large
  
   round-trip delay time
  
  , which gives slow two-way communication, but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information.
 
  Apart from any physical transmission medium there may be, networks comprise additional basic
  
   system
  
  building blocks, such as
  
   network interface controller
  
  (NICs),
  
   repeaters
  
  ,
  
   hubs
  
  ,
  
   bridges
  
  ,
  
   switches
  
  ,
  
   routers
  
  ,
  
   modems
  
  , and
  
   firewalls
  
  .
 
  A
  
   network interface controller
  
  (NIC) is
  
   computer hardware
  
  that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.
 
  The NIC responds to traffic addressed to a
  
   network address
  
  for either the NIC or the computer as a whole.
 
  In
  
   Ethernet
  
  networks, each network interface controller has a unique
  
   Media Access Control
  
  (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the
  
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
  
  (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six
  
   octets
  
  . The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.
 
  A
  
   repeater
  
  is an
  
   electronic
  
  device that receives a network
  
   signal
  
  , cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is
  
   retransmitted
  
  at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.
 
  A repeater with multiple ports is known as a
  
   hub
  
  . Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model. Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a
  
   propagation delay
  
  that affects network performance. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row, e.g., the Ethernet
  
   5-4-3 rule
  
  .
 
  Hubs have been mostly obsoleted by modern
  
   switches
  
  ; but repeaters are used for long distance links, notably undersea cabling.
 
  A
  
   network bridge
  
  connects and filters traffic between two
  
   network segments
  
  at the
  
   data link layer
  
  (layer 2) of the
  
   OSI model
  
  to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.
 
  Bridges come in three basic types:
 
  A
  
   network switch
  
  is a device that forwards and filters
  
   OSI layer 2
  

   datagrams
  
  (
  
   frames
  
  ) between
  
   ports
  
  based on the destination MAC address in each frame.
  

    [9]
   

  A switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.
  

    [10]
   

  It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.
 

   Multi-layer switches
  
  are capable of routing based on layer 3 addressing or additional logical levels. The term
  
   switch
  
  is often used loosely to include devices such as routers and bridges, as well as devices that may distribute traffic based on load or based on application content (e.g., a Web
  
   URL
  
  identifier).
 
  A
  
   router
  
  is an
  
   internetworking
  
  device that forwards
  
   packets
  
  between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3). The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table). A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a "null" interface, also known as the "black hole" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.
 

   Modems
  
  (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more
  
   carrier signals
  
  are
  
   modulated
  
  by the digital signal to produce an
  
   analog signal
  
  that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a
  
   Digital Subscriber Line
  
  technology.
 
  A
  
   firewall
  
  is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in
  
   cyber attacks
  
  .
 

   Network topology
  
  is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.
 
  Common layouts are:
 
  Note that the physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with
  
   FDDI
  
  , the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location.
 
  An
  
   overlay network
  
  is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many
  
   peer-to-peer
  
  networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.
  

    [11]
   


  Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using
  
   modems
  
  , before any data network existed.
 
  The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the
  
   telephone network
  
  .
  

    [11]
   

  Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies.
  
   Address resolution
  
  and
  
   routing
  
  are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.
 
  Another example of an overlay network is a
  
   distributed hash table
  
  , which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a
  
   map
  
  ) indexed by keys.
 
  Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through
  
   quality of service
  
  guarantees to achieve higher-quality
  
   streaming media
  
  . Previous proposals such as
  
   IntServ
  
  ,
  
   DiffServ
  
  , and
  
   IP Multicast
  
  have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all
  
   routers
  
  in the network.

  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from
  
   Internet service providers
  
  . The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.
 
  For example,
  
   Akamai Technologies
  
  manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of
  
   multicast
  
  ). Academic research includes end system multicast,
  

    [12]
   

  resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.
 
  A
  
   communications protocol
  
  is a set of rules for exchanging information over network links. In a
  
   protocol stack
  
  (also see the
  
   OSI model
  
  ), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol below it. An important example of a protocol stack is
  
   HTTP
  
  (the
  
   World Wide Web protocol
  
  ) running over
  
   TCP
  
  over
  
   IP
  
  (the
  
   Internet protocols
  
  ) over
  
   IEEE 802.11
  
  (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the
  
   wireless router
  
  and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.
 
  Whilst the use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking, it has been historically criticized by many researchers
  

    [13]
   

  for two principal reasons. Firstly, abstracting the protocol stack in this way may cause a higher layer to duplicate functionality of a lower layer, a prime example being error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis.
  

    [14]
   

  Secondly, it is common that a protocol implementation at one layer may require data, state or addressing information that is only present at another layer, thus defeating the point of separating the layers in the first place. For example,
  
   TCP
  
  uses the ECN field in the
  
   IPv4 header
  
  as an indication of congestion; IP is a
  
   network layer
  
  protocol whereas TCP is a
  
   transport layer
  
  protocol.
 
  Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be
  
   connection-oriented
  
  or
  
   connectionless
  
  , they may use
  
   circuit mode
  
  or
  
   packet switching
  
  , and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.
 
  There are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.
 

   IEEE 802
  
  is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the
  
   OSI model
  
  .
 
  For example,
  
   MAC
  

   bridging
  
  (
  
   IEEE 802.1D
  
  ) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a
  
   Spanning Tree Protocol
  
  .
  
   IEEE 802.1Q
  
  describes
  
   VLANs
  
  , and
  
   IEEE 802.1X
  
  defines a port-based
  
   Network Access Control
  
  protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a "wireless access key".
 

   Ethernet
  
  , sometimes simply called
  
   LAN
  
  , is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called
  
   IEEE 802.3
  
  published by the
  
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
  
  .
 

   Wireless LAN
  
  , also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the
  
   IEEE 802
  
  protocol family for home users today. It is standarized by
  
   IEEE 802.11
  
  and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.
 
  The
  
   Internet Protocol Suite
  
  , also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by data-gram transmission at the
  
   Internet protocol
  
  (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for
  
   Internet Protocol Version 4
  
  (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.
 

   Synchronous optical networking
  
  (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized
  
   multiplexing
  
  protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed,
  
   circuit-switched
  
  voice encoded in
  
   PCM
  
  (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting
  
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode
  
  (ATM) frames.
 

   Asynchronous Transfer Mode
  
  (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous
  
   time-division multiplexing
  
  and encodes data into small, fixed-sized
  
   cells
  
  . This differs from other protocols such as the
  
   Internet Protocol Suite
  
  or
  
   Ethernet
  
  that use variable sized packets or
  
   frames
  
  . ATM has similarity with both
  
   circuit
  
  and
  
   packet
  
  switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time,
  
   low-latency
  
  content such as voice and video. ATM uses a
  
   connection-oriented
  
  model in which a
  
   virtual circuit
  
  must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.
 
  While the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of
  
   next-generation networks
  
  , it still plays a role in the
  
   last mile
  
  , which is the connection between an
  
   Internet service provider
  
  and the home user.
  

    [15]
   


  A network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.
 
  A
  
   nanoscale communication
  
  network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.
  

    [16]
   


  A
  
   personal area network
  
  (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.
  

    [17]
   

  A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.
 
  A
  
   local area network
  
  (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a
  
   node
  
  . Wired LANs are most likely based on
  
   Ethernet
  
  technology. Newer standards such as
  
   ITU-T
  

   G.hn
  
  also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.
  

    [18]
   


  The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a
  
   wide area network
  
  (WAN), include higher
  
   data transfer rates
  
  , limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on
  
   leased lines
  
  to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other
  
   IEEE 802.3
  
  LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to
  
   100 Gbit/s
  
  , standarized by
  
   IEEE
  
  in 2010.
  

    [19]
   

  Currently,
  
   400 Gbit/s Ethernet
  
  is being developed.
 
  A LAN can be connected to a WAN using a
  
   router
  
  .
 
  A
  
   home area network
  
  (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or
  
   digital subscriber line
  
  (DSL) provider.
 
  A
  
   storage area network
  
  (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.
 
  A
  
   campus area network
  
  (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant,
  
   Cat5
  
  cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).
 
  For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.
 
  A
  
   backbone network
  
  is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or sub-networks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.
 
  For example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. When designing a network backbone,
  
   network performance
  
  and
  
   network congestion
  
  are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.
 
  Another example of a backbone network is the
  
   Internet backbone
  
  , which is the set of
  
   wide area networks
  
  (WANs) and
  
   core routers
  
  that tie together all networks connected to the
  
   Internet
  
  .
 
  A
  
   Metropolitan area network
  
  (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.
 
  A
  
   wide area network
  
  (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the
  
   OSI reference model
  
  : the
  
   physical layer
  
  , the
  
   data link layer
  
  , and the
  
   network layer
  
  .
 
  An
  
   enterprise private network
  
  is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.
 
  A
  
   virtual private network
  
  (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.
 
  VPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.
 
  A
  
   global area network
  
  (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial
  
   wireless LANs
  
  .

  Networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the
  
   Internet
  
  , which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.
 
  An
  
   intranet
  
  is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. The intranet uses the
  
   IP
  
  protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.
 
  An
  
   extranet
  
  is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.
 
  An
  
   internetwork
  
  is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.
 
  The
  
   Internet
  
  is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the
  
   Internet Protocol Suite
  
  . It is the successor of the
  
   Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
  
  (ARPANET) developed by
  
   DARPA
  
  of the
  
   United States Department of Defense
  
  . The Internet is also the communications backbone underlying the
  
   World Wide Web
  
  (WWW).
 
  Participants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system (
  
   IP addresses
  
  ) administered by the
  
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  
  and
  
   address registries
  
  . Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the
  
   reachability
  
  of their address spaces through the
  
   Border Gateway Protocol
  
  (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.
 
  A
  
   darknet
  
  is an overlay network, typically running on the internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called "friends" (
  
   F2F
  
  )
  

    [21]
   

  — using non-standard
  
   protocols
  
  and
  
   ports
  
  .
 
  Darknets are distinct from other distributed
  
   peer-to-peer
  
  networks as
  
   sharing
  
  is anonymous (that is,
  
   IP addresses
  
  are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.
  

    [22]
   



   Routing
  
  is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including
  
   circuit switching
  
  networks and
  
   packet switched networks
  
  .
 
  In packet switched networks, routing directs
  
   packet forwarding
  
  (the transit of logically addressed
  
   network packets
  
  from their source toward their ultimate destination) through intermediate
  
   nodes
  
  . Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as
  
   routers
  
  ,
  
   bridges
  
  ,
  
   gateways
  
  ,
  
   firewalls
  
  , or
  
   switches
  
  . General-purpose
  
   computers
  
  can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of
  
   routing tables
  
  , which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's
  
   memory
  
  , is very important for efficient routing.
 
  There are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):
 
  Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time.
  
   Multipath routing
  
  techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.
 
  Routing, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with
  
   bridging
  
  in its assumption that
  
   network addresses
  
  are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.
 

   Network services
  
  are applications hosted by
  
   servers
  
  on a computer network, to
  
   provide some functionality
  
  for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.
 
  The
  
   World Wide Web
  
  ,
  
   E-mail
  
  ,
  

    [23]
   


   printing
  
  and
  
   network file sharing
  
  are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as DNS (
  
   Domain Name System
  
  ) give names for
  
   IP
  
  and
  
   MAC addresses
  
  (people remember names like “nm.lan” better than numbers like “210.121.67.18”),
  

    [24]
   

  and
  
   DHCP
  
  to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.
  

    [25]
   


  Services are usually based on a
  
   service protocol
  
  that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.
 
  Depending on the installation requirements,
  
   network performance
  
  is usually measured by the
  
   quality of service
  
  of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include
  
   throughput
  
  ,
  
   jitter
  
  ,
  
   bit error rate
  
  and
  
   latency
  
  .
 
  The following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of
  
   packet-switched network
  
  , viz. ATM:
 
  There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example,
  
   state transition diagrams
  
  are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.
  

    [28]
   



   Network congestion
  
  occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its
  
   quality of service
  
  deteriorates. Typical effects include
  
   queueing delay
  
  ,
  
   packet loss
  
  or the
  
   blocking
  
  of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in
  
   offered load
  
  lead either only to small increase in network
  
   throughput
  
  , or to an actual reduction in network throughput.
 

   Network protocols
  
  that use aggressive
  
   retransmissions
  
  to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion—even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as
  
   congestive collapse
  
  .
 
  Modern networks use
  
   congestion control
  
  and
  
   congestion avoidance
  
  techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include:
  
   exponential backoff
  
  in protocols such as
  
   802.11
  
  's
  
   CSMA/CA
  
  and the original
  
   Ethernet
  
  ,
  
   window
  
  reduction in
  
   TCP
  
  , and
  
   fair queueing
  
  in devices such as
  
   routers
  
  . Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is
  
   802.1p
  
  . A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the
  
   ITU-T
  

   G.hn
  
  standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s)
  
   Local area networking
  
  over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).
 
  For the Internet
  
   RFC 2914
  
  addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.
 

   Network resilience
  
  is "the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of
  
   service
  
  in the face of
  
   faults
  
  and challenges to normal operation.”
  

    [29]
   



   Network security
  
  consists of provisions and policies adopted by the
  
   network administrator
  
  to prevent and monitor
  
   unauthorized
  
  access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.
  

    [30]
   

  Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.
 

   Network surveillance
  
  is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the
  
   Internet
  
  . The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.
 
  Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.
 
  Surveillance is very useful to governments and
  
   law enforcement
  
  to maintain
  
   social control
  
  , recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate
  
   criminal
  
  activity. With the advent of programs such as the
  
   Total Information Awareness
  
  program, technologies such as
  
   high speed surveillance computers
  
  and
  
   biometrics
  
  software, and laws such as the
  
   Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act
  
  , governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.
  

    [31]
   


  However, many
  
   civil rights
  
  and
  
   privacy
  
  groups—such as
  
   Reporters Without Borders
  
  , the
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  , and the
  
   American Civil Liberties Union
  
  —have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a
  
   mass surveillance
  
  society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as
  

    Hepting v. AT&T
   

  .

    [32]
   

  The
  
   hacktivist
  
  group
  
   Anonymous
  
  has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers "draconian surveillance".

   End-to-end encryption
  
  (E2EE) is a
  
   digital communications
  
  paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party
  
   encrypting
  
  data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as
  
   Internet providers
  
  or
  
   application service providers
  
  , from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both
  
   confidentiality
  
  and
  
   integrity
  
  .
 
  Examples of end-to-end encryption include
  
   PGP
  
  for
  
   email
  
  ,
  
   OTR
  
  for
  
   instant messaging
  
  ,
  
   ZRTP
  
  for
  
   telephony
  
  , and
  
   TETRA
  
  for radio.
 
  Typical
  
   server
  
  -based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between
  
   clients
  
  and
  
   servers
  
  , not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are
  
   Google Talk
  
  ,
  
   Yahoo Messenger
  
  ,
  
   Facebook
  
  , and
  
   Dropbox
  
  . Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering "end-to-end" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a
  
   back door
  
  that subverts negotiation of the
  
   encryption key
  
  between the communicating parties, for example
  
   Skype
  
  or
  
   Hushmail
  
  .
 
  The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the
  
   technical exploitation
  
  of
  
   clients
  
  , poor quality
  
   random number generators
  
  , or
  
   key escrow
  
  . E2EE also does not address
  
   traffic analysis
  
  , which relates to things such as the identities of the end points and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.
 
  Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running. A
  
   community of interest
  
  has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via
  
   peer-to-peer
  
  technologies.
 
  Network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g.,
  
   routers
  
  ,
  
   bridges
  
  and
  
   application layer gateways
  
  ) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture,
  
   subnets
  
  , map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using
  
   virtual LAN (VLAN)
  
  technology.
 
  Both users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an
  
   intranet
  
  is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).
  

    [35]
   

  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An
  
   extranet
  
  is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).
  

    [35]
   


  Unofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by
  
   Internet Service Providers
  
  (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the
  
   Internet
  
  is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, which share the registered
  
   IP address
  
  space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the
  
   Border Gateway Protocol
  
  . Typically, the
  
   human-readable
  
  names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the
  
   Domain Name System
  
  (DNS).
 
  Over the Internet, there can be
  
   business-to-business (B2B)
  
  ,
  
   business-to-consumer (B2C)
  
  and
  
   consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
  
  communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of
  
   communications security
  
  mechanism. Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure
  
   Virtual Private Network
  
  (VPN) technology.
