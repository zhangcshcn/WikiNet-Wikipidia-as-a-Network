   iPad Mini
  
  (branded and marketed as
  
   iPad mini
  
  ) is a line of
  
   mini tablet computers
  
  designed, developed, and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  It is a sub-series of the
  
   iPad
  
  line of tablets, with a reduced screen size of 7.9 inches, in contrast to the standard 9.7 inches. The
  
   first generation iPad Mini
  
  was announced on October 23, 2012, and was released on November 2, 2012, in nearly all of Apple's markets.

  It features similar internal specifications to the
  
   iPad 2
  
  , including its display resolution.
 
  The
  
   second generation iPad Mini
  
  , with a faster processor and a
  
   Retina Display
  
  , was announced on October 22, 2013 and released on November 12, 2013.
 
  The
  
   third generation iPad Mini
  
  was announced on October 16, 2014 and was released on October 22, 2014; it features the same hardware as the Mini 2 and the addition of a
  
   Touch ID
  
  fingerprint sensor compatible with
  
   Apple Pay
  
  .
  

    [7]
   


  On September 9, 2015, Apple released the
  
   iPad Mini 4
  
  .
 


  On October 16, 2012, Apple announced plans for a
  
   media event
  
  on October 23 at the
  
   California Theatre
  
  in
  
   San Jose
  
  ,
  
   California
  
  .

  The company did not give the subject of the event, but it was widely expected to be the iPad Mini.
  

    [10]
   

  At the event, Apple CEO
  
   Tim Cook
  
  introduced a new version of
  
   MacBook family
  
  and new generations of the
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  ,
  
   Mac Mini
  
  , and the
  
   iMac
  
  , then unveiled the
  
   fourth-generation iPad
  
  and the iPad Mini.
  

    [11]
   


  The iPad Mini comes with several pre-installed applications, including
  
   Siri
  
  ,
  
   Safari
  
  , Mail, Photos, Video, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar,
  
   Game Center
  
  , Photo Booth, and Contacts.
  

    [12]
   

  Like all
  
   iOS devices
  
  , the iPad can sync content and other data with a Mac or PC using iTunes and to Apple's
  
   iCloud
  
  online service. Although the tablet is not designed to make telephone calls over a cellular network, users can use a headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or cellular using a
  
   VoIP
  
  application, such as
  
   Skype
  
  .
  

    [13]
   

  iPads offer
  
   dictation
  
  when connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network.
  

    [14]
   


  Applications from Apple and third-party developers can be downloaded through the
  
   App Store
  
  , an
  
   application
  

   distribution
  
  market for iOS that is maintained and regulated by Apple. The service allows users to browse and purchase
  
   applications
  
  . Optional apps from Apple that can be purchased through the App Store include
  
   GarageBand
  
  ,
  
   iMovie
  
  ,
  
   iPhoto
  
  , and the
  
   iWork
  
  apps (
  
   Pages
  
  ,
  
   Keynote
  
  , and
  
   Numbers
  
  ) are available.
  

    [15]
   


  The device has an optional
  
   iBooks
  
  application, which displays books and other
  
   ePub
  
  -format content downloaded from the
  
   iBookstore
  
  .
  

    [16]
   

  Several major book publishers including
  
   Penguin Books
  
  ,
  
   HarperCollins
  
  ,
  
   Simon & Schuster
  
  and
  
   Macmillan
  
  have committed to publishing books for the device.
  

    [17]
   

  Despite the iPad being a direct competitor to both the
  
   Amazon Kindle
  
  and
  
   Barnes & Noble Nook
  
  ,
  

    [18]
   

  both
  
   Amazon.com
  
  and
  
   Barnes & Noble
  
  offer e-reader apps for the iPad.
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   


  On June 8, 2015, it was announced at the
  
   WWDC
  
  that all three generations of the iPad Mini would support
  
   iOS 9
  
  . However, certain new multitasking features, such as Slide Over and Picture in Picture, will be limited to the second and third generation. Split View, another new multitasking feature, is only available on the iPad Mini 4.
  

    [21]
   


  The current version of iOS, iOS 10, is supported on iPad Mini 2 and up. An upgrade to this version is available as a free download.
 
  The first generation iPad Mini shipped with iOS 6.0
  

    [22]
   

  and the highest supported version is iOS 9.3.5.
 
  There are four buttons and one switch on the iPad Mini, including a "home" button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three aluminum buttons on the right side and top:
  
   wake/sleep
  
  and
  
   volume up
  
  and
  
   volume down
  
  , plus a software-controlled switch whose function varies with software updates.
  

    [5]
   

  The tablet is manufactured either with or without the capability to communicate over a
  
   cellular network
  
  . All models can connect to a
  
   wireless LAN
  
  via Wi-Fi. The iPad Mini is available with 16, 32, 64 and 128 GB of internal
  
   flash memory
  
  , with no expansion option. Apple sells a "camera connection kit" with an
  
   SD card
  
  reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.
 
  The first generation iPad Mini features partially the same hardware as the
  
   iPad 2
  
  . Both screens have resolutions of 1024x768, but the iPad Mini has a smaller screen and thus higher pixel density than iPad 2 (163 PPI vs. 132 PPI).
  

    [5]
   

  Unlike the iPad 2, it has 5 MP and 1.2 MP cameras and the
  
   Lightning connector
  
  . The system-on-chip is
  
   A5
  
  , which is the same one found in the later revision of the iPad 2 (32 nm). The audio processor is the same found in iPhone 5 and iPad 4th generation, which allows the iPad Mini to have Siri and voice dictation unlike the iPad 2. The
  
   graphics processor
  
  (GPU) of the first generation iPad Mini is the same one found in the iPad 2 (
  
   PowerVR
  

   SGX
  
  543MP2).
  

    [23]
   


  iPads with a data connection can download data through cellphone networks, but can not make voice calls. They can act as a
  
   hotspot
  
  , sharing the Internet connection over Wi-Fi,
  
   Bluetooth
  
  , or
  
   USB
  
  .
  

    [14]
   


  The
  
   Smart Cover
  
  , introduced with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad. A smaller version is now available for iPad Mini. The cover has three folds, which allow it to convert into a stand, held together by magnets.
  

    [24]
   

  Smart Covers have a
  
   microfiber
  
  bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed. It comes in six colors of
  
   polyurethane
  
  .
  

    [25]
   



    [26]
   


  Apple offers other accessories, including a Bluetooth keyboard, several types of earbuds or headphones and many adapters for the
  
   Lightning connector
  
  .
  

    [27]
   


   AppleCare
  
  and free
  
   engraving
  
  are also available for the iPad Mini.
  

    [28]

  The most recent model is the
  
   iPad Mini 4
  
  . The

    [35]
   



    [40]

  The device competes with tablets such as the
  
   Amazon Kindle Fire HD
  
  ,
  
   Google Nexus 7
  
  , and
  
   Barnes & Noble Nook HD
  
  .

   Retina Display
  
  and price.
  

    [39]
   

  The iPad Mini 2 was well received, praising the Retina Display and
