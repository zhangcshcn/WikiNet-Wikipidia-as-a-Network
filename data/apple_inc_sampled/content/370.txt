   International Business Machines Corporation
  
  (commonly referred to as
  
   IBM
  
  ) is an American
  
   multinational
  

   technology
  
  company headquartered in
  
   Armonk, New York
  
  ,
  
   United States
  
  , with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the
  
   Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
  
  (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924.
 
  IBM manufactures and markets computer
  
   hardware
  
  ,
  
   middleware
  
  and
  
   software
  
  , and offers
  
   hosting
  
  and
  
   consulting services
  
  in areas ranging from
  
   mainframe computers
  
  to
  
   nanotechnology
  
  . IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most
  
   patents
  
  generated by a business (as of 2017) for 24 consecutive years.
  

    [5]
   

  Inventions by IBM include the
  
   automated teller machine
  
  (ATM), the
  
   floppy disk
  
  , the
  
   hard disk drive
  
  , the
  
   magnetic stripe card
  
  , the
  
   relational database
  
  , the
  
   SQL programming language
  
  , the
  
   UPC barcode
  
  , and
  
   dynamic random-access memory
  
  (DRAM).
 
  IBM has continually shifted its business mix by exiting
  
   commoditizing
  

   markets
  
  and focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes
  
   spinning off
  
  printer manufacturer
  
   Lexmark
  
  in 1991 and selling off its
  
   personal computer
  
  (
  
   ThinkPad
  
  /
  
   ThinkCentre
  
  ) and
  
   x86
  
  -based
  
   server
  
  businesses to
  
   Lenovo
  
  (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as
  
   PwC Consulting
  
  (2002),
  
   SPSS
  
  (2009), and
  
   The Weather Company
  
  (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go "
  
   fabless
  
  ", continuing to design
  
   semiconductors
  
  , but offloading manufacturing to
  
   GlobalFoundries
  
  .
 
  Nicknamed
  
   Big Blue
  
  , IBM is one of 30 companies included in the
  
   Dow Jones Industrial Average
  
  and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as "IBMers", IBM employees have been awarded five
  
   Nobel Prizes
  
  , six
  
   Turing Awards
  
  , ten
  
   National Medals of Technology
  
  and five
  
   National Medals of Science
  
  .
 


  In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of what would become International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885;
  

    [6]
   

  Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);
  

    [7]
   


   Herman Hollerith
  
  patented the
  
   Electric Tabulating Machine
  
  ;
  

    [8]
   

  and
  
   Willard Bundy
  
  invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.
  

    [9]
   

  On June 16, 1911, their four companies were
  
   amalgamated
  
  in New York State by
  
   Charles Ranlett Flint
  
  forming a fifth company, the
  
   Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
  
  (CTR) based in
  
   Endicott, New York
  
  .
  

    [1]
   



    [10]
   

  The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and
  
   Binghamton
  
  , New York;
  
   Dayton, Ohio
  
  ;
  
   Detroit, Michigan
  
  ;
  
   Washington, D.C.
  
  ; and
  
   Toronto
  
  . They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards.
  
   Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
  
  , fired from the
  
   National Cash Register Company
  
  by
  
   John Henry Patterson
  
  , called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR.
  

    [11]
   

  Watson joined CTR as
  
   General Manager
  
  then, 11 months later, was made
  
   President
  
  when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.
  

    [12]
   

  Having learned Patterson's
  
   pioneering business practices
  
  , Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies.
  

    [13]
   

  He implemented sales conventions, "generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker".
  

    [14]
   



    [15]
   

  His favorite slogan, "
  
   THINK
  
  ", became a mantra for each company's employees.
  

    [14]
   

  During Watson's first four years, revenues more than doubled to $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.
  

    [14]
   

  "Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR" and in 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title "International Business Machines".
  

    [16]
   

  By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.
  

    [17]
   


  In 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the
  
   U.S. Government
  
  , during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the
  
   Social Security Act
  
  ,
  

    [18]
   

  and Hitler's
  
   Third Reich
  
  ,
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   

  largely through the German subsidiary
  
   Dehomag
  
  . During the
  
   Second World War
  
  the company produced small arms for the American war effort (
  
   M1 Carbine
  
  , and
  
   Browning Automatic Rifle
  
  ).
 
  In 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.
  

    [21]
   

  In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son
  
   Thomas Watson, Jr.
  
  was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of
  
   artificial intelligence
  
  when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an
  
   IBM 704
  
  not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience. In 1957, the
  
   FORTRAN
  
  scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the
  
   SABRE reservation system
  
  for
  
   American Airlines
  
  and introduced the highly successful
  
   Selectric
  
  typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to
  
   Armonk, New York
  
  . The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.
 
  On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the
  
   IBM System/360
  
  . Sold between 1964 and 1978, it spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their application. In 1974, IBM engineer
  
   George J. Laurer
  
  developed the
  
   Universal Product Code
  
  .
  

    [22]
   

  IBM and the
  
   World Bank
  
  first introduced
  
   financial swaps
  
  to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.
  

    [23]
   

  The
  
   IBM PC
  
  , originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer
  
   Lexmark
  
  .
 
  In 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history.
  

    [24]
   


   Lou Gerstner
  
  was hired as CEO from
  
   RJR Nabisco
  
  to turn the company around.
  

    [25]
   

  In 2002, IBM acquired
  
   PwC
  
  consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key
  
   business
  
  issues with 50,000 employees. The result was three values: "Dedication to every client's success", "Innovation that mattersâ€”for our company and for the world", and "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships".
  

    [26]
   



    [27]
   


  In 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company
  
   Lenovo
  


    [28]
   

  and, in 2009, it acquired software company
  
   SPSS Inc.
  
  Later in 2009, IBM's
  
   Blue Gene
  
  supercomputing program was awarded the
  
   National Medal of Technology and Innovation
  
  by
  
   U.S. President
  

   Barack Obama
  
  . In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its
  
   artificial intelligence
  
  program
  
   Watson
  
  , which was exhibited on
  

    Jeopardy!
   

  where it won against game-show champions
  
   Ken Jennings
  
  and
  
   Brad Rutter
  
  . In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy
  
   Kenexa
  
  , and a year later it also acquired
  
   SoftLayer Technologies
  
  , a
  
   web hosting service
  
  , in a deal worth around $2 billion.
  

    [29]
   


  In 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for a fee of $2.1 billion.
  

    [30]
   

  Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  ,

    [42]
   


   Sesame Workshop
  
  ,
  

    [43]
   

  the parent company of
  
   Sesame Street
  
  , and
  
   Salesforce.com
  
  .
  

    [44]
   


  In 2015, IBM announced two major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion
  

    [45]
   

  and all digital assets from
  
   The Weather Company
  
  , including
  
   Weather.com
  
  and the Weather Channel
  
   mobile app
  
  .
  

    [46]
   



    [47]
   

  Also that year, IBMers created the film
  

    A Boy and His Atom
   

  , which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service
  
   Ustream
  
  and formed a new cloud video unit.
  

    [48]
   



    [49]
   

  In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.
  

    [50]
   

  The following month,
  
   Groupon
  
  sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.
  

    [51]
   


  IBM is headquartered in
  
   Armonk, New York
  
  , a community 37 miles (60Â km) north of Midtown Manhattan.
  

    [52]
   

  Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a 283,000-square-foot (26,300Â m
  
   2
  
  ) glass and stone edifice on a 25-acre (10Â ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s.
  

    [53]
   

  There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM's headquarters; and the IBM Learning Center (ILC), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.
  

    [54]
   


  IBM operates in 170 countries as of 2016,
  

    [2]
   

  with mobility centers in smaller markets areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In
  
   New York City
  
  , IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including the
  
   IBM Watson
  
  headquarters at
  
   Astor Place
  
  in
  
   Manhattan
  
  . Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States include
  
   Austin, Texas
  
  ;
  
   Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina
  
  ;
  
   Rochester, Minnesota
  
  ; and
  
   Silicon Valley, California
  
  .
 
  IBM's real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include
  
   1250 RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque
  
  (Montreal, Canada),
  
   Tour Descartes
  
  (Paris, France), and
  
   One Atlantic Center
  
  (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). In
  
   Beijing, China
  
  , IBM occupies Pangu Plaza, which is the city's
  
   seventh tallest building
  
  and overlooks
  
   Beijing National Stadium ("Bird's Nest")
  
  , which was home to the
  
   2008 Summer Olympics
  
  .
 
  Other notable buildings include the
  
   IBM Rome Software Lab
  
  (Rome, Italy), the
  
   Hursley House

   IBM Canada Head Office Building
  
  (Ontario, Canada). Defunct IBM campuses include the
  
   IBM Somers Office Complex
  
  (Somers, New York). The company's contributions to industrial architecture and design include works by
  
   Eero Saarinen
  
  ,
  
   Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
  
  and
  
   I.M. Pei
  
  . Van der Rohe's building in Chicago, the original center of the company's research division post-World War II, was recognized with the 1990
  
   Honor Award
  
  from the
  
   National Building Museum
  
  .
  

    [55]
   

  IBM was recognized as one of the Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters by the
  
   United States Environmental Protection Agency
  
  (EPA) in 2005, which recognized
  
   Fortune 500
  
  companies that provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution.
  

    [56]
   

  In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM's contribution in its early days to
  
   pollution
  
  in its original location in
  
   Endicott, New York
  
  .
  

    [57]
   



    [58]
   


  IBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016, these offerings fall into the categories of

   managed hosting
  
  and
  
   cloud computing
  
  provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers.
  

    [61]
   

  IBM also offers Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using
  
   cryptographic splitting
  
  to secure customer data.
  

    [62]
   


  IBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect each year.
  

    [63]
   



   Hardware
  
  designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's
  
   POWER microprocessors
  
  , which are employed inside many
  
   console gaming systems
  
  , including
  
   Xbox 360
  
  ,
  

    [64]
   


   PlayStation 3
  
  , and
  
   Nintendo
  
  's
  
   Wii U
  
  .
  

    [65]
   



    [66]
   

  IBM
  
   Secure Blue
  
  is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors,
  

    [67]
   

  and in 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 billion over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.
  

    [68]
   

  In 2016, the company launched
  
   all-flash arrays
  
  designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.
  

    [69]
   



   IT outsourcing
  
  also represents a major service offered by IBM, with more than 40
  
   data centers
  
  worldwide.
  

    [70]
   


   alphaWorks
  
  is IBM's source for emerging software technologies, and
  
   SPSS
  
  is a
  
   software package
  
  used for
  
   statistical analysis
  
  . IBM's
  
   Kenexa
  
  suite provides
  
   employment
  
  and

    [78]
   



   IBM Watson
  
  is a technology platform that uses
  
   natural language processing
  
  and
  
   machine learning
  
  to reveal insights from large amounts of
  
   unstructured data
  
  .
  

    [79]
   

  Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game-show
  

    Jeopardy!
   

  , where it competed against champions
  
   Ken Jennings
  
  and
  
   Brad Rutter
  
  in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with
  
   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
  
  to assist with considering treatment options for
  
   oncology
  
  patients and for doing
  
   melanoma
  
  screenings.
  

    [80]
   

  Also, several companies have begun using Watson for
  
   call centers
  
  , either replacing or assisting customer service agents.
  

    [81]
   


  Research has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at
  
   Columbia University
  
  in
  
   New York City
  
  , converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now,
  
   IBM Research
  
  constitutes the largest
  
   industrial research
  
  organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.
  

    [82]
   

  IBM Research is headquartered at the
  
   Thomas J. Watson Research Center
  
  in New York, and facilities include the
  
   Almaden lab
  
  in California,
  
   Austin lab
  
  in Texas,
  
   Australia lab
  
  in
  
   Melbourne
  
  ,
  
   Brazil lab
  
  in
  
   SÃ£o Paulo
  
  and
  
   Rio de Janeiro
  
  ,
  
   China lab
  
  in
  
   Beijing
  
  and
  
   Shanghai
  
  ,
  
   Ireland lab
  
  in Dublin,
  
   Haifa lab
  
  in
  
   Israel
  
  ,
  
   India lab
  
  in
  
   Delhi
  
  and
  
   Bangalore
  
  ,
  
   Tokyo lab
  
  ,
  
   Zurich lab
  
  and
  
   Africa lab
  
  in
  
   Nairobi
  
  .
 
  In terms of investment, IBM's
  
   R&D
  
  spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9 billion USD.
  

    [83]
   

  Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for
  
   Watson
  
  in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.
  

    [84]
   


  IBM has been a leading proponent of the
  
   Open Source Initiative
  
  , and began supporting
  
   Linux
  
  in 1998.
  

    [85]
   

  The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM
  
   Linux Technology Center
  
  , which includes over 300
  
   Linux kernel
  
  developers.
  

    [86]
   

  IBM has also released code under different
  
   open source licenses
  
  , such as the
  
   platform-independent
  

   software framework
  

   Eclipse
  
  (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation),
  

    [87]
   

  the three-sentence
  
   International Components for Unicode
  
  (
  
   ICU
  
  ) license, and the
  
   Java
  
  -based
  
   relational database management system
  
  (RDBMS)
  
   Apache Derby
  
  . IBM's
  
   open source
  
  involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see
  

    SCO v. IBM
   

  ).
 
  Famous inventions and developments by IBM include: the
  
   Automated teller machine (ATM)
  
  ,
  
   Dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
  
  , the
  
   electronic keypunch
  
  , the
  
   financial swap
  
  , the
  
   floppy disk
  
  , the
  
   hard disk drive
  
  , the
  
   magnetic stripe card
  
  , the
  
   relational database
  
  ,
  
   RISC
  
  , the
  
   SABRE airline reservation system
  
  ,
  
   SQL
  
  , the
  
   Universal Product Code (UPC)
  
  bar code, and the
  
   virtual machine
  
  . Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a
  
   scanning tunneling microscope
  
  to arrange 35
  
   individual xenon atoms
  
  to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time.
  

    [88]
   

  A major part of IBM research is the generation of
  
   patents
  
  . Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most
  
   patents
  
  generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.

  Five IBMers have received the
  
   Nobel Prize
  
  :
  
   Leo Esaki
  
  , of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors;
  
   Gerd Binnig
  
  and
  
   Heinrich Rohrer
  
  , of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the
  
   scanning tunneling microscope
  
  ;
  

    [89]
   

  and
  
   Georg Bednorz
  
  and
  
   Alex MÃ¼ller
  
  , also of Zurich, in 1987, for research in
  
   superconductivity
  
  . Several IBMers have also won the
  
   Turing Award
  
  , including the first female recipient
  
   Frances E. Allen
  
  .
  

    [90]
   


  Current research includes a collaboration with the
  
   University of Michigan
  
  to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university,
  

    [91]
   

  and a partnership with
  
   AT&T
  
  , combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable and to provide developers with easier tools.
  

    [92]
   


  IBM is nicknamed
  
   Big Blue
  
  in part due to its blue logo and color scheme,
  

    [93]
   



    [94]
   

  and also partially since IBM once had a de facto
  
   dress code
  
  of white shirts with blue suits.
  

    [93]
   



    [95]
   

  The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar"
  
   logo
  
  designed in 1972 by
  
   graphic designer
  

   Paul Rand
  
  .
  

    [96]
   

  It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render large areas well.
 
  IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the
  
   Masters Tournament
  
  , one of the four
  
   major championships
  
  in
  
   professional golf
  
  , with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).
  

    [97]
   

  As a result, IBM CEO
  
   Ginni Rometty
  
  became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the
  
   Augusta National Golf Club
  
  .
  

    [98]
   

  IBM is also a major sponsor in professional
  
   tennis
  
  , with engagements at the
  
   U.S. Open
  
  ,
  
   Wimbledon
  
  , the
  
   Australian Open
  
  , and the
  
   French Open
  
  .
  

    [99]
   

  The company also sponsored the
  
   Olympic Games
  
  from 1960-2000,
  

    [100]
   

  and the
  
   National Football League
  
  from 2003-2012.
  

    [101]
   


  In 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by
  

    Interbrand
   

  as the â„–2 best brand worldwide.
  

    [102]
   

  That same year, it was also ranked the â„–1 company for leaders (
  

    Fortune
   

  ), the â„–2
  
   green company
  
  in the U.S. (
  

    Newsweek
   

  ),
  

    [103]
   

  the â„–2 most respected company (
  

    Barron's
   

  ),
  

    [104]
   

  the â„–5 most admired company (
  

    Fortune
   

  ), the â„–18 most innovative company (
  

    Fast Company
   

  ), and the â„–1 in
  
   technology consulting
  
  and â„–2 in
  
   outsourcing
  
  (
  
   Vault
  
  ).
  

    [105]
   

  In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM the â„–5 most valuable brand.
  

    [106]
   


  IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as "IBMers". The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO
  
   Thomas J. Watson, Jr.
  
  published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in
  
   Brown vs. Board of Education
  
  and 11 years before the
  
   Civil Rights Act of 1964
  
  . The
  
   Human Rights Campaign
  
  has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,
  

    [107]
   

  with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with
  
   health benefits
  
  and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use
  
   genetic information
  
  in employment decisions; and in 2015, IBM was named to
  

    Working Mother's
   

  100 Best Companies List for the 30th consecutive year.
  

    [108]
   


  IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g.,
  
   general management
  
  (GMLDP),
  
   human resources
  
  (HRLDP),
  
   finance
  
  (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),
  

    [109]
   

  which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the
  
   Peace Corps
  
  and gives top employees a month to do
  
   humanitarian work
  
  abroad.
  

    [110]
   

  For certain
  
   interns
  
  , IBM also has a program called
  
   Extreme Blue
  
  that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.
  

    [111]
   


  The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).
  

    [112]
   

  Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of
  
   Master Inventor
  
  . The company's most prestigious designation is that of
  
   IBM Fellow
  
  . Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.
 
  IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.
  

    [113]
   

  During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO
  
   Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.
  
  relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.
  

    [114]
   

  The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying is stands for "I've Been Moved" due to relocations and layoffs,
  

    [115]
   

  others saying it stands for "I'm By Myself" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,
  

    [116]
   

  and others saying it stands for "I'm Being Mentored" due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.
  

    [117]
   

  In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing,
  

    [118]
   

  although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.
  

    [119]
   

  In Japan, IBM employees also have an
  
   American football
  
  team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese
  
   X-League
  
  as the "
  
   Big Blue
  
  ".
  

    [120]
   


  In 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a
  
   PC
  
  or a
  
   Mac
  
  as their primary work device, resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop.
  

    [121]
   

  In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.
  

    [122]
