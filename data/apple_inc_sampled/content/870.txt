   Google Energy LLC
  
  is a subsidiary company of
  
   Google
  
  , which was created to reduce costs of energy consumption of the Google Group, and subsequently to produce and sell
  
   clean energy
  
  . The division also allows it to take advantage of projects funded through the philanthropic
  
   Google.org
  
  .
 


  By 2007 Google had invested a substantial amount of money in
  
   wind
  
  ,
  
   solar
  
  ,
  
   solar thermal
  
  , and
  
   geothermal
  
  projects, including a 1.6 MW solar installation pilot project at its headquarters. In 2010 Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable-energy project, putting up
  
   US$
  
  38.8 million for two wind farms in
  
   North Dakota
  
  . The company announced that the two locations will generate 169.5 MW of power, or enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by
  
   NextEra Energy Resources
  
  , will reduce fossil fuel use in the region. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty percent stake in the project in order to get funding for project development.

  In addition, on July 30, 2010, Google Energy agreed to purchase 114 MW of Iowa wind energy from NextEra Energy at a fixed rate for 20 years.

  The corporation plans to primarily use the electricity for Google's data centers, but it may also be sold on the open market.
 
  In 2010 Google Energy, together with a group of other investors, announced a plan to build the
  
   Atlantic Wind Connection
  
  , an undersea cable off the Atlantic coast to connect future offshore wind farms with on-shore transmission grids.

  In April 2011, Google extended its partnership with NextEra by signing a 20-year
  
   power purchase agreement
  
  (PPA) for its Minco II Wind Energy Center.

  As of 2011, the 100.8-megawatt wind farm is being developed in the Grady and Caddo counties near Minco.

  Google invested two rounds in
  
   SolarCity
  
  , $280 million in 2011 and $300 million in 2015.

  On September 17, 2013, the corporation announced its plan to purchase all of the electricity produced by the 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm that will be located near Amarillo, Texas, US upon the completion of the farm's construction. Purchased from the wind farms owners Chermac Energy, Google Energy will sell the electricity from Happy Hereford into the wholesale market in Oklahoma, the location of one of its data centers.

  As of 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , Google has power purchase agreements for 2,600 MW.

  In February 2010, the
  
   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
  
  FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.
  

    [12]
   

  The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities.
