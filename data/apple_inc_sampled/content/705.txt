   Facebook
  
  is an American
  
   for-profit corporation
  
  and an online
  
   social media
  
  and
  
   social networking service
  
  based in
  
   Menlo Park, California
  
  . The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by
  
   Mark Zuckerberg
  
  , along with fellow
  
   Harvard College
  
  students and roommates,
  
   Eduardo Saverin
  
  ,
  
   Andrew McCollum
  
  ,
  
   Dustin Moskovitz
  
  , and
  
   Chris Hughes
  
  .

  The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to
  
   higher education institutions in the Boston area
  
  , the
  
   Ivy League
  
  schools, and
  
   Stanford University
  
  . Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws.
  

    [8]
   

  The Facebook name comes from the
  
   face book
  
  directories often given to United States university students.
  

    [9]
   


  Facebook may be accessed by a large range of
  
   desktops
  
  ,
  
   laptops
  
  ,
  
   tablet computers
  
  , and
  
   smartphones
  
  over the
  
   Internet
  
  and
  
   mobile networks
  
  . After registering to use the site, users can create a
  
   user profile
  
  indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as
  
   "friends"
  
  , exchange messages, post status updates and
  
   digital photos
  
  , share digital videos and links, use various
  
   software applications
  
  ("apps"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from
  
   advertisements
  
  which appear onscreen.
 
  Facebook, Inc. held its
  
   initial public offering
  
  (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling
  
   stock
  
  to the public three months later, reaching an original peak
  
   market capitalization
  
  of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the
  
   Standard & Poor's 500 Index
  
  to reach a market cap of $250 billion.
  

    [10]
   

  Facebook has more than
  
   1.86 billion monthly active users
  
  as of December 31, 2016.
  

    [11]
   

  As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts.
  

    [12]
   

  Facebook classifies users from the ages of 13 to 18 as minors and therefore sets their profiles to share content with friends only.
  

    [13]
   


  Zuckerberg wrote a program called "Facemash" on October 28, 2003 while attending
  
   Harvard University
  
  as a
  
   sophomore
  
  (second year student). According to
  

    The Harvard Crimson
   

  , the site was comparable to
  
   Hot or Not
  
  and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person".
  

    [14]
   



    [15]
   



    [16]
   


  To accomplish this, Zuckerberg
  
   hacked
  
  into protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied private dormitory
  
   ID
  
  images. Harvard did not have a student "
  
   face book
  
  " (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s, and Harvard's longtime Freshman Yearbook was colloquially referred to as the "Freshman Facebook". Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.
  

    [14]
   



    [17]
   


  The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating
  
   copyrights
  
  , and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.
  

    [18]
   

  Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an
  
   art history
  
  final exam. He uploaded 500
  
   Augustan
  
  images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section.
  

    [17]
   

  He shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.
 
  The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He said that he was inspired by an editorial about the Facemash incident in
  
   The Harvard Crimson
  
  .
  

    [19]
   

  On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.
  

    [20]
   


  Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors
  
   Cameron Winklevoss
  
  ,
  
   Tyler Winklevoss
  
  , and
  
   Divya Narendra
  
  accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called
  
   HarvardConnection.com
  
  . They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.
  

    [21]
   

  The three complained to
  
   The Harvard Crimson
  
  and the newspaper began an investigation. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling in 2008
  

    [22]
   

  for 1.2 million
  
   shares
  
  (worth $300 million at Facebook's
  
   IPO
  
  ).
  

    [23]
   


  Membership was initially restricted to students of
  
   Harvard College
  
  ; within the first month, more than half the undergraduates at Harvard were registered on the service.
  

    [7]
   


   Eduardo Saverin
  
  (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer),
  
   Andrew McCollum
  
  (graphic artist), and
  
   Chris Hughes
  
  joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of
  
   Columbia
  
  ,
  
   Stanford
  
  , and
  
   Yale
  
  .
  

    [24]
   

  It later opened to all
  
   Ivy League
  
  colleges,
  
   Boston University
  
  ,
  
   New York University
  
  ,
  
   MIT
  
  , and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada.
  

    [25]
   



    [26]
   


  In mid-2004, entrepreneur
  
   Sean Parker
  
  —an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became the company's president.
  

    [27]
   

  In June 2004, Facebook moved its operations base to
  
   Palo Alto, California
  
  .
  

    [24]
   

  It received its first investment later that month from
  
   PayPal
  
  co-founder
  
   Peter Thiel
  
  .
  

    [28]
   

  In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the
  
   domain name
  
  facebook.com for
  
   US$
  
  200,000.
  

    [29]
   

  The domain facebook.com belonged to AboutFace Corporation before the purchase. This website last appeared on April 8, 2005;
  

    [30]
   

  from April 10, 2005 to August 4, 2005, this domain gave a 403 error.
  

    [31]
   


  In May 2005,
  
   Accel Partners
  
  invested $12.7 million in Facebook, and
  
   Jim Breyer
  


    [32]
   

  added $1 million of his own money. A high-school version of the site was launched in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.
  

    [33]
   

  (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.)
  

    [34]
   

  Facebook also expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  and Microsoft.
  

    [35]
   


  On September 26, 2006, Facebook was opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid
  
   email address
  
  .
  

    [36]
   



    [37]
   



    [38]
   


  In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned.
  

    [39]
   

  Pages began rolling out for businesses in May 2009.
  

    [40]
   


  On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion.
  

    [41]
   

  Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements on the social networking site.
  

    [42]
   


  In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in
  
   Dublin
  
  , Ireland.
  

    [43]
   

  Almost a year later, in September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.
  

    [44]
   


  A January 2009
  
   Compete.com
  
  study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide
  
   monthly active users
  
  .
  

    [45]
   



    Entertainment Weekly
   

  included the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list saying, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of
  
   Scrabulous
  
  before Facebook?"
  

    [46]
   


  Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. The company announced 500 million users in July 2010
  

    [47]
   

  making it the largest online social network in the world at the time. According to the company's data, half of the site's membership use Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users access the site by mobile. A company representative called the milestone a "quiet revolution."
  

    [48]
   


  In November 2010, based on
  
   SecondMarket
  
  Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41 billion. The company had slightly surpassed
  
   eBay
  
  to become the third largest American web company after
  
   Google
  
  and
  
   Amazon.com
  
  .
  

    [49]
   


  In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  campus in Menlo Park, California.
  

    [50]
   



    [51]
   

  In March 2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing approximately 20,000 profiles offline every day for violations such as spam, graphic content, and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost
  
   cyber security
  
  .
  

    [52]
   


  Release of statistics by
  
   DoubleClick
  
  showed that Facebook reached one trillion
  
   page views
  
  in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website tracked by DoubleClick.
  

    [53]
   

  According to a Nielsen Media Research study, released in December 2011, Facebook had become the second-most accessed website in the U.S. behind Google.
  

    [54]
   


  Facebook eventually filed for an
  
   initial public offering
  
  on February 1, 2012.
  

    [55]
   

  Facebook
  
   held an initial public offering
  
  on May 17, 2012, negotiating a share price of US$38. The company was valued at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.
  

    [56]
   



    [57]
   



    [58]
   


  Facebook began selling stock to the public and trading on the
  
   NASDAQ
  
  on May 18, 2012.
  

    [59]
   

  Based on its 2012 income of $5 billion, Facebook joined the
  
   Fortune 500
  
  list for the first time in May 2013, ranked in position 462.
  

    [60]
   


  Facebook filed their S1 document with the
  
   Securities and Exchange Commission
  
  on February 1, 2012. The company applied for a $5 billion IPO, one of the biggest offerings in the history of technology.
  

    [61]
   

  The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. history.
  

    [62]
   



    [63]
   


  The shares began trading on May 18; the stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, but set a record for the trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares).
  

    [64]
   

  The first day of trading was marred by technical glitches that prevented orders from going through;
  

    [65]
   



    [66]
   

  only the technical problems and artificial support from underwriters prevented the stock price from falling below the IPO price on the day.
  

    [67]
   


  In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the site. The store was to be available on
  
   iPhones
  
  ,
  
   Android
  
  devices, and mobile web users.
  

    [68]
   


  On May 22, 2012, the Yahoo! Finance website reported that Facebook's lead underwriters,
  
   Morgan Stanley
  
  (MS),
  
   JP Morgan
  
  (JPM), and
  
   Goldman Sachs
  
  (GS), cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO process.
  

    [69]
   

  The stock had begun its freefall by this time, closing at 34.03 on May 21 and 31.00 on May 22. A
  
   "circuit breaker"
  
  was used in an attempt to slow down the stock price's decline.
  

    [70]
   

  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
  
   Mary Schapiro
  
  , and
  
   Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
  
  (FINRA) Chairman Rick Ketchum, called for a review of the circumstances surrounding the IPO.
  

    [71]
   


  Facebook's IPO was consequently investigated, and was compared to a
  
   pump and dump
  
  scheme.
  

    [65]
   



    [69]
   



    [71]
   



    [72]
   

  A class-action lawsuit was filed in May 2012 because of the trading glitches, which led to botched orders.
  

    [73]
   



    [74]
   

  Lawsuits were filed, alleging that an underwriter for Morgan Stanley selectively revealed adjusted earnings estimates to preferred clients.
  

    [75]
   


  The other underwriters (MS, JPM, GS), Facebook's CEO and board, and NASDAQ also faced litigation after numerous lawsuits were filed, while SEC and FINRA both launched investigations.
  

    [76]
   

  It was believed that adjustments to earnings estimates were communicated to the underwriters by a Facebook financial officer, who used the information to cash out on their positions while leaving the general public with overpriced shares.
  

    [77]
   

  By the end of May 2012, Facebook's stock lost over a quarter of its starting value, which led
  

    The Wall Street Journal
   

  to label the IPO a "fiasco".
  

    [78]
   


  Zuckerberg announced to the media at the start of October 2012 that Facebook had passed the monthly active users mark of one billion.
  

    [79]
   

  Facebook defines active users as a logged-in member who visits the site, or accesses it through a third-party site connected to Facebook, at least once a month. Fake accounts were not mentioned in the announcement, but the company continued to remove them after it found that 8.7% of its users were not real in August 2012. The company's data also revealed 600 million mobile users, 140 billion friend connections since the inception of Facebook, and the median age of a user as 22 years.
  

    [47]
   


  On January 15, 2013, Facebook announced
  
   Facebook Graph Search
  
  , which provides users with a "precise answer", rather than a link to an answer by leveraging the data present on its site.
  

    [80]
   

  Facebook emphasized that the feature would be "privacy-aware," returning only results from content already shared with the user.
  

    [81]
   


  The company became the subject of a lawsuit by Rembrandt Social Media in February 2013, for patents involving the "Like" button.
  

    [82]
   

  On April 3, 2013, Facebook unveiled
  
   Facebook Home
  
  , a user-interface layer for Android devices offering greater integration with the site.
  
   HTC
  
  announced the
  
   HTC First
  
  , a
  
   smartphone
  
  with Home pre-loaded.
  

    [83]
   


  On April 15, 2013, Facebook announced an alliance across 19 states with the National Association of Attorneys General, to provide teenagers and parents with information on tools to manage social networking profiles.
  

    [84]
   

  On April 19, 2013, Facebook officially modified its logo to remove the faint blue line at the bottom of the "F" icon. The letter F moved closer to the edge of the box.
  

    [85]
   


  Following a campaign by 100 advocacy groups, Facebook agreed to update its policy on hate speech. The campaign highlighted content promoting domestic and sexual violence against women, and used over 57,000 tweets and more than 4,900 emails that caused withdrawal of advertising from the site by 15 companies, including Nissan UK, House of Burlesque and Nationwide UK. The social media website initially responded by stating that "while it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies".
  

    [86]
   

  It decided to take action on May 29, 2013, after it "become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate."
  

    [87]
   


  On June 12, 2013, Facebook announced on its newsroom that it was introducing clickable
  
   hashtags
  
  to help users follow trending discussions, or search what others are talking about on a topic.
  

    [88]
   

  A July 2013
  
   Wall Street Journal
  
  article identified the Facebook IPO as the cause of a change in the U.S.' national economic statistics, as the local government area of the company's headquarters,
  
   San Mateo County
  
  , California, became the top wage-earning county in the country after the fourth quarter of 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average weekly wage in the county was
  
   US$
  
  3,240, 107% higher than the previous year. It noted the wages were "the equivalent of $168,000 a year, and more than 50% higher than the next-highest county,
  
   New York County
  
  (better known as
  
   Manhattan
  
  ), at $2,107 a week, or roughly $110,000 a year."
  

    [89]
   


  Russian internet firm Mail.Ru sold its Facebook shares for US$525 million on September 5, 2013, following its initial $200 million investment in 2009. Partly owned by Russia's richest man,
  
   Alisher Usmanov
  
  , the firm owned a total of 14.2 million remaining shares prior to the sale.
  

    [90]
   

  In the same month, the Chinese government announced that it will lift the ban on Facebook in the
  
   Shanghai Free Trade Zone
  
  "to welcome foreign companies to invest and to let foreigners live and work happily in the free-trade zone." Facebook was first blocked in China in 2009.
  

    [91]
   


  Facebook was announced as a member of
  
   The Alliance for Affordable Internet
  
  (A4AI) in October 2013, when the A4AI was launched. The A4AI is a coalition of public and private organizations that includes
  
   Google
  
  ,
  
   Intel
  
  and Microsoft. Led by
  
   Sir Tim Berners-Lee
  
  , the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.
  

    [92]
   


  A
  
   Reuters
  
  report, published on December 11, 2013, stated that
  
   Standard & Poor's
  
  announced the placement of Facebook on its
  
   S&P 500
  
  index "after the close of trading on December 20."
  

    [93]
   

  Facebook announced Q4 2013 earnings of $523 million (20 cents per share), an increase of $64 million from the previous year,
  

    [94]
   

  as well as 945 million mobile users.
 
  By January 2014, Facebook's market capitalization had risen to over $134 billion.
  

    [56]
   



    [95]
   

  At the end of January 2014, 1.23 billion users were active on the website every month.
 
  The company celebrated its 10th anniversary during the week of February 3, 2014.
  

    [96]
   

  In each of the first three months of 2014, over one billion users logged into their Facebook account on a mobile device.
  

    [97]
   


  In February 2014, Facebook announced that it would be buying mobile messaging company Whatsapp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.
  

    [98]
   

  In June 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of Pryte, a Finnish mobile data-plan firm that aims to make it easier for mobile phone users in underdeveloped parts of the world to use wireless Internet apps.
  

    [99]
   


  At the start of July 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of LiveRail, a San Francisco, California-based online video advertising company. LiveRail's technology facilitates the sale of video inventory across different devices. The terms of the deal were undisclosed, but
  

    TechCrunch
   

  reported that Facebook paid between US$400 million and $500 million.
  

    [100]
   



    [101]
   

  As part of the company's second quarter results, Facebook announced in late July 2014 that mobile accounted for 62% of its advertising revenue, which is an increase of 21% from the previous year.
  

    [102]
   


  Alongside other American technology figures like
  
   Jeff Bezos
  
  and
  
   Tim Cook
  
  , Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin—although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.
  

    [103]
   

  A book of Chinese president Xi Xinping found on Zuckerberg's office desk attracted a great deal of attention in the media, after the Facebook founder explained to Lu, "I want them [Facebook staff] to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics."
  

    [104]
   


  Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The question of whether the platform would adopt a dislike button was raised again, and Zuckerberg said, "We're [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] … It's an interesting question," and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions.
  

    [105]
   



    [106]
   

  In October 2015, Zuckerberg said that instead of creating a dislike button, Facebook is testing emoji reactions as an alternative to the 'like' button.
  

    [107]
   

  On February 24, 2016, Facebook launched
  
   Facebook Reactions
  
  , which allows users to respond to posts with multiple reactions in addition to "liking" it.
  

    [108]
   

  According to a study by quintly- a social media analytics company, these reactions were hardly used initially immediately after the release of the Facebook Reactions.
  

    [109]
   

  However, the second study revealed that the use of Facebook Reactions is picking up. They reported that the Facebook pages with more than 10 million fans, the new Facebook Reactions increased by a remarkable 47%.

  As of January 21, 2015, Facebook's algorithm is programmed to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes, and will be supported by users who select the option to flag a story as "purposefully fake or deceitful news." According to Reuters, such content is "being spread like a wildfire" on the social media platform. Facebook maintained that "satirical" content, "intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire," will be taken into account and should not be intercepted.
  

    [111]
   

  The algorithm, however, has been accused of maintaining a "
  
   filter bubble
  
  ", where both material the user disagrees with
  

    [112]
   

  and posts with a low level of likes, will also not be seen.

  The ownership percentages of the company, as of 2012
  

    [update]
   

  , were:
 
  A small group of current and former employees and celebrities own less than 1% each, including
  
   Matt Cohler
  
  , Jeff Rothschild,
  
   Adam D'Angelo
  
  , Chris Hughes, and
  
   Owen Van Natta
  
  , while
  
   Reid Hoffman
  
  and
  
   Mark Pincus
  
  have sizable holdings of the company. The remaining 30% or so are owned by employees, an undisclosed number of celebrities, and outside investors.
  

    [132]
   

  Adam D'Angelo, former chief technology officer and friend of Zuckerberg, resigned in May 2008. Reports claimed that he and Zuckerberg began quarreling, and that he was no longer interested in partial ownership of the company.
  

    [133]
   


  Key management personnel consist of:
  
   Chris Cox
  
  (Chief Product Officer), Sandberg (COO), and Zuckerberg (Chairman and CEO).
  
   Mike Vernal
  
  is considered to be the company's top engineer.

  Facebook was named the 5th best company to work for in 2014 by company-review site Glassdoor as part of its sixth annual Employees' Choice Awards. The website stated that 93% of Facebook employees would recommend the company to a friend.
  

    [137]
   


  Most of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising.
  

    [146]
   



    [147]
   

  Facebook generally has a lower
  
   clickthrough rate
  
  (CTR) for advertisements than most major websites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole,
  

    [148]
   

  although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while
  
   Google
  
  users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches),
  

    [149]
   

  Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).
  

    [150]
   


  Sarah Smith, who was Facebook's Online Sales Operations Manager until 2012,
  

    [151]
   

  reported that successful
  
   advertising campaigns
  
  on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and that CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.
  

    [152]
   


  The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling
  
   ad blocking
  
  software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site's primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing.
  

    [153]
   

  According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook's Social Advertising platform compared to 2011.
  

    [154]
   

  However,
  
   Time
  
  writer and reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:
 
   A big part of Facebook's pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may not worry so much about losing its cool cachet.
   

     [155]
    



     [156]
    


  Despite Facebook's age demographics, a study has identified five distinctive kinds of high
  
   LSM
  
  Facebook users. The study found that the popular assumption among advertisers that the wealthy aren’t engaging with
  
   social media
  
  platforms, was incorrect. For brands or companies to leverage Facebook as an advertising medium to higher LSM users, extensive
  
   target market
  
  and customer base knowledge is required to execute an effective
  
   marketing strategy
  
  .
  

    [157]
   



    [158]
   



    [159]
   


  A portion of Facebook revenue comes from the "firehose" access, bulk access to the social media data sold to the third parties.
  

    [160]
   



    [161]
   


  In December 2014, a report from Frank N. Magid and Associates found that the percentage of teens aged 13 to 17 who used Facebook fell to 88% in 2014, down from 94% in 2013 and 95% in 2012.
  

    [162]
   


  Zuckerberg, alongside other Facebook executives, have questioned the data in such reports; although, a former Facebook senior employee has commented: "Mark [Zuckerberg] is very willing to recognize the strengths in other products and the flaws in Facebook."
  

    [163]
   


  On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts.
  

    [164]
   

  A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40% of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video, while the industry average was 25% for in-banner video ads.
  

    [165]
   


  The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm
  
   eMarketer
  
  released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google's share was 32.4 per cent).
  

    [96]
   

  Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for around 62 per cent of advertising revenue, an increase of approximately 41 per cent over the comparable quarter of the previous year.
 
  In February 2015, Facebook announced that it had reached two million active advertisers with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser is an advertiser that has advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.
  

    [166]
   

  In March 2016, Facebook announced that it reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the US.
  

    [167]
   


  On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the
  
   American Farm Bureau Federation
  
  for an undisclosed amount. On January 11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5 million in "domain sales income", making the acquisition of FB.com one of the ten highest domain sales in history.
  

    [168]
   


  In November 2016 Facebook acquired CrowdTangle, a social analytics company that tracks how content spreads online. CrowdTangle confirmed the acquisition in a message at their website, but company didn't disclosed financial terms of the deal.

  In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move to its new headquarters, the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park.
  

    [170]
   


  All users outside of the US and Canada have a contract with Facebook's Irish subsidiary "Facebook Ireland Limited". This allows Facebook to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Facebook is making use of the
  
   Double Irish arrangement
  
  which allows it to pay just about 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.

  In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in
  
   Hyderabad
  


    [172]

  Facebook, which in 2010 had more than 750 million active users globally including over 23 million in India, announced that its
  
   Hyderabad
  
  center would house online advertising and developer support teams and provide round-the-clock, multilingual support to the social networking site's users and advertisers globally.
  

    [176]
   

  With this, Facebook joins other giants like
  
   Google
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft
  
  ,
  
   Oracle
  
  ,
  
   Dell

  Though Facebook did not specify its India investment or hiring figures, it said recruitment had already begun for a director of operations and other key positions at Hyderabad,
  

    [181]
   

  which would supplement its operations in
  
   California

  On October 1, 2012, CEO Zuckerberg visited Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.
  

    [187]
   

  Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. Facebook has roughly 9 million users in Russia, while
  
   domestic analogue VK
  
  has around 34 million.

  The functioning of a woodwork facility on the Menlo Park campus was announced at the end of August 2013. The facility, opened in June 2013, provides equipment, safety courses and woodwork learning course, while employees are required to purchase materials at the in-house store. A Facebook spokesperson explained that the intention of the facility is to encourage employees to think in an innovative manner because of the different environment, and also serves as an attractive perk for prospective employees.

      Inside the Facebook headquarters in 2014
     
  Facebook is both a consumer of and contributor to
  
   free and open source software
  
  .
  

    [191]
   

  Facebook's contributions include:
  
   HipHop for PHP
  
  ,
  

    [192]
   

  Fair scheduler in
  
   Apache Hadoop
  
  ,
  

    [193]
   


   Apache Hive
  
  ,
  
   Apache Cassandra
  
  ,
  

    [194]
   

  and the
  
   Open Compute Project
  
  .
  

    [195]
   


  Facebook also contributes to other opensource projects such as
  
   Oracle
  
  's
  
   MySQL
  
  database engine.
  

    [196]
   



    [197]
   


  The website's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is
  
   red-green colorblind
  
  , a realization that occurred after a test undertaken around 2007; he explained in 2010: "blue is the richest color for me—I can see all of blue."
  

    [201]
   



    [202]
   

  Facebook is built in
  
   PHP
  
  which is compiled with
  
   HipHop for PHP
  
  , a 'source code transformer' built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into
  
   C++
  
  .
  

    [203]
   

  The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.
  

    [204]
   


  Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom
  
   BitTorrent
  
  -based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.
  

    [204]
   


  Facebook used a combination platform based on
  
   HBase
  
  to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as
  
   AJAX
  
  behavior. These requests are written to a log file using
  
   Scribe
  
  (developed by Facebook).
  

    [205]
   


  Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different
  
   data centers
  
  (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a
  
   hash table
  
  .
  

    [205]
   


  After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with
  
   HipHop for PHP
  
  ). The backend is written in
  
   Java
  
  and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to
  
   MapReduce
  
  servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.
  

    [205]
   


  On March 20, 2014 Facebook announced a new open source programming language called
  
   Hack
  
  . Prior to public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and "battle tested" using the new language.
  

    [206]
   


  Facebook uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to deliver the enormous volume of emails it sends to its users every day.
  

    [207]
   


  On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a "cleaner" look.
  

    [208]
   

  After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.
  

    [209]
   

  On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.
  

    [210]
   


  The format of individual user pages was revamped in late 2011 and became known as either a profile or personal timeline since that change.
  

    [228]
   



    [229]
   

  Users can create profiles with photos and images, lists of personal interests, contact information, memorable life events, and other personal information, such as employment status.
  

    [230]
   

  Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages, as well as a chat feature, and share content that includes website URLs, images, and video content.
  

    [231]
   

  A 2012 Pew Internet and American Life study identified that between 20 and 30 percent of Facebook users are "power users" who frequently link, poke, post and tag themselves and others.
  

    [232]
   


  In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages (also called "Fan Pages" by users) to allow "users to interact and affiliate with businesses and organizations in the same way they interact with other Facebook user profiles". On November 6, 2007, more than 100,000 Facebook pages were launched.
  

    [233]
   


  In July 2012, Facebook added a
  
   same-sex marriage
  
  icon to its timeline feature.
  

    [234]
   

  On February 14, 2014, Facebook expanded the options for user's gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of
  
   gender-specific pronouns
  
  are used in reference to them throughout the site.
  

    [235]
   



    [236]
   

  The change occurs after Nepal's first openly gay politician
  
   Sunil Babu Pant
  
  sent a letter to Zuckerberg in early 2012 to request the addition of an "Other" gender option for Facebook users; Facebook's official statement on the issue: "People can already opt out of showing their sex on their profile. We're constantly innovating on our products and features and we welcome input from everyone as we explore ways to improve the Facebook experience."
  

    [237]
   


  On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a "Usernames" feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler
  
   URLs
  
  such as
  

    https://www.facebook.com/name
   

  instead of
  

    https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728
   

  .
  

    [238]
   

  Many new
  
   smartphones
  
  offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems
  
   Android
  
  ,
  
   iOS
  
  ,
  
   webOS
  
  , and
  
   Firefox OS
  
  .
  
   Nokia
  
  and
  
   Research In Motion
  
  both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices. As of January 2015, 745 million active users access Facebook through mobile devices every day.

  In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new 'ask' button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.
  

    [239]
   


  On September 6, 2006,
  
   News Feed
  
  was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.
  

    [240]
   

  This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.
  

    [241]
   

  Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).
  

    [242]
   


  In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.
  

    [243]
   


  On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent
  

    [244]
   

  on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.
  

    [245]
   

  The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as
  
   Twitter
  
  .

  One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the
  
   Photos
  
  application, where users can upload albums and photos.
  

    [247]
   

  Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other
  
   image hosting services
  
  such as
  
   Photobucket
  
  and
  
   Flickr
  
  , which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60 photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200 photos per album.

    [250]
   



    [251]
   


  Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to "
  
   tag
  
  ", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that she has been tagged, and provides a link to see the photo.

  On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease.
  

    [253]
   

  Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps.
  

    [254]
   


  The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the
  
   EdgeRank
  
  algorithm.
  

    [255]
   


  On May 13, 2015 Facebook in association with major news portals launched a program "Instant Articles" to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook news feed without leaving the site.
  

    [256]
   



    [257]
   


  According to the technology news web site
  
   Gizmodo
  
  on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppress or promote news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about
  
   Black Lives Matter
  
  would be listed even if they did not meet the trending criteria of News Feed. Likewise positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages.
  

    [258]
   


  In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.
  

    [259]
   


  The like button is a social networking feature, allowing users to express their appreciation of content such as status updates, comments, photos, and advertisements. It is also a
  
   social plug-in of the Facebook Platform
  
  – launched on April 21, 2010
  

    [260]
   



    [261]
   

  – that enables participating Internet websites to display a similar like button.
 
  The sheriff of Hampton, Virginia, US fired employees who liked the Facebook page of an adversary, and a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that the US Constitution protects the rights of US citizens to like any Facebook page of their choosing. US Circuit Judge William Traxler likened the practice to displaying a "political sign in one's front yard."
  

    [262]
   

  Additionally, the
  
   United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
  
  upheld a
  
   National Labor Relations Board
  
  decision which found that one employee's "liking" another employee's negative comments about their employer deserved protection under the
  
   National Labor Relations Act
  
  , alerting employers to proceed with caution when disciplining employees for Facebook activity.
  

    [263]
   


  Following a lengthy period of calls from the public to include a dislike button on the Facebook interface, Zuckerberg explained in a Q&A session on December 11, 2014 that his hesitance was due to a concern about a tone of negativity on the platform, whereby users could "shame" others, and he offered the comment option for situations where people were unwilling to use the like function. However, he said, "We're [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] … It's an interesting question," and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions.
  

    [106]
   


  On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a "Subscribe" button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add him or her as a friend.
  

    [264]
   

  In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts.
  

    [265]
   


  In December 2012, Facebook announced that because of user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a "Follow" button—making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.
  

    [266]
   


  The media often compares Facebook to
  
   Myspace
  
  , but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.
  

    [267]
   

  Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.
  

    [268]
   

  MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using
  
   HTML
  
  and
  
   Cascading Style Sheets
  
  (CSS), while Facebook allows only
  
   plain text
  
  .
  

    [269]
   

  Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the
  
   Wall
  
  , a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;
  

    [270]
   


   Pokes
  
  , which allows users to send a virtual "poke" to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked);
  

    [271]
   


   Photos
  
  , that allows users to upload albums and photos;
  

    [272]
   

  and
  
   Status
  
  , which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.
  

    [273]
   

  Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.
  

    [270]
   

  Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses
  
   Google
  
  and
  
   AdSense
  
  .
  

    [274]
   

  There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as
  
   LinkedIn
  
  , than Myspace users.
  

    [274]
   


  Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.
  

    [276]
   

  The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as
  
   banner ads
  
  .
  

    [277]
   

  Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.
  

    [278]
   


  On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched
  
   Facebook Beacon
  
  , which was a part of Facebook's advertisement system until it was discontinued in 2009. Its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends.
 
  In 2010, Facebook's security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users'
  
   privacy
  
  ,
  

    [279]
   

  but
  
   privacy concerns
  
  remain.
  

    [280]
   


  Since 2010, among other social media services, the
  
   National Security Agency
  
  has been taking publicly posted profile information from users Facebook profiles to discover who they interact with.
  

    [281]
   


  On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled
  
   Federal Trade Commission
  
  charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.
  

    [282]
   


  In August 2013
  
   High-Tech Bridge
  
  published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.
  

    [283]
   

  In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.
  

    [284]
   


  On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of $500 for reporting security holes on Facebook's website. Facebook's
  
   Whitehat
  
  page for security researchers says: "If you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you."
  

    [285]
   



    [286]
   


  Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded "White Hat" debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. "Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them," Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook's security response team, told CNET in an interview. "Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say 'I did special work for Facebook.'"
  

    [287]
   


  India, which has the second largest number of bug hunters in the world,
  

    [288]
   

  tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. "Researchers in Russia earned the highest amount per report in 2013, receiving an average of $3,961 for 38 bugs. India contributed the largest number of valid bugs at 136, with an average reward of $1,353. The U.S. reported 92 issues and averaged $2,272 in rewards. Brazil and the UK were third and fourth by volume, with 53 bugs and 40 bugs, respectively, and average rewards of $3,792 and $2,950", Facebook quoted in a post.
  

    [289]
   


  According to
  
   comScore
  
  , Facebook is the leading social networking site based on monthly unique visitors, having overtaken main competitor
  
   MySpace
  
  in April 2008.
  

    [290]
   

  ComScore reports that Facebook attracted over 130 million unique visitors in May 2010, an increase of 8.6 million people.
  

    [291]
   

  According to third-party
  
   web analytics
  
  providers,
  
   Alexa
  
  and
  
   SimilarWeb
  
  , Facebook is ranked second and first globally respectively, it is the highest-read social network on the Web, with over 20 billion visitors per month, as of 2015.
  

    [292]
   



    [293]
   



    [294]
   


   SimilarWeb
  
  ,
  
   Quantcast
  
  , and
  
   Compete.com
  
  all rank the website 2nd in the U.S. in traffic.
  

    [293]
   



    [295]
   



    [296]
   

  The website is the most popular for uploading photos, cumulatively with 50 billion uploaded.
  

    [297]
   

  In 2010,
  
   Sophos
  
  's "Security Threat Report 2010" polled over 500 firms, 60% of which responded that they believed Facebook was the social network that "posed the biggest threat to security," well ahead of MySpace, Twitter, and
  
   LinkedIn
  
  .
  

    [279]
   


  Facebook is the most popular social networking site in several
  
   English-speaking countries
  
  , including Canada,
  

    [298]
   

  the United Kingdom,
  

    [299]
   

  and the United States.
  

    [300]
   



    [301]
   



    [302]
   

  However, Facebook still receives limited adoption in countries such as Japan, where domestically created social networks are still largely preferred.
  

    [303]
   

  In regional Internet markets, penetration on Facebook is highest in North America (69 percent), followed by Middle East-Africa (67 percent), Latin America (58 percent), Europe (57 percent), and Asia-Pacific (17 percent).
  

    [304]
   

  Some of the top competitors were listed in 2007 by
  
   Mashable
  
  .
  

    [305]
   


  The website has won awards such as placement into the "Top 100 Classic Websites" by
  

    PC Magazine
   

  in 2007,
  

    [306]
   

  and winning the "People's Voice Award" from the
  
   Webby Awards
  
  in 2008.
  

    [307]
   

  In a 2006 study conducted by Student Monitor, a company specializing in research concerning the college student market, Facebook was named the "second most popular thing among undergraduates," tied with beer and only ranked lower than the
  
   iPod
  
  .
  

    [308]
   


  In 2010, Facebook won the
  
   Crunchie
  
  "Best Overall Startup Or Product" for the third year in a row
  

    [309]
   

  and was recognized as one of the "Hottest
  
   Silicon Valley
  
  Companies" by Lead411.
  

    [310]
   

  However, in a July 2010 survey performed by the
  
   American Customer Satisfaction Index
  
  , Facebook received a score of 64 out of 100, placing it in the bottom 5% of all private-sector companies in terms of customer satisfaction, alongside industries such as the
  
   IRS e-file
  
  system, airlines, and
  
   cable companies
  
  . The reasons why Facebook scored so poorly include privacy problems, frequent changes to the website's interface, the results returned by the News Feed, and spam.
  

    [311]
   


  In December 2008, the
  
   Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory
  
  ruled that Facebook is a valid
  
   protocol
  
  to serve court notices to defendants. It is believed to be the world's first legal judgement that defines a
  
   summons
  
  posted on Facebook as legally binding.
  

    [325]
   

  In March 2009, the New Zealand High Court associate justice David Gendall allowed for the serving of legal papers on Craig Axe by the company Axe Market Garden via Facebook.
  

    [326]
   



    [327]
   

  Employers have also used Facebook as a means to keep tabs on their employees and have even been known to fire them over posts they have made.
  

    [328]
   


  By 2005, the use of Facebook had already become so ubiquitous that the generic verb "facebooking" had come into use to describe the process of browsing others' profiles or updating one's own.
  

    [329]
   

  In 2008,
  
   Collins English Dictionary
  
  declared "Facebook" as its new Word of the Year.
  

    [330]
   

  In December 2009, the
  
   New Oxford American Dictionary
  
  declared its word of the year to be the verb "
  
   unfriend
  
  ", defined as "To remove someone as a '
  
   friend
  
  ' on a
  
   social networking
  
  site such as Facebook.
  

    [331]
   


  In early 2010,
  
   Openbook
  
  was established, an avowed
  
   parody
  
  (and privacy advocacy) website
  

    [332]
   

  that enables text-based searches of those Wall posts that are available to "Everyone", i.e. to everyone on the Internet.
 
  Writers for
  

    The Wall Street Journal
   

  found in 2010 that Facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to "dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies". The apps used an
  
   HTTP referer
  
  which exposed the user's identity and sometimes their friends'. Facebook said, "We have taken immediate action to disable all applications that violate our terms".
  

    [333]
   


  In May 2014, the countries with the most Facebook users were:
  

    [334]
   


  Facebook's popularity throughout the world (especially as a tool for political movements or procrastination) has led to some countries and employers
  
   blocking access
  
  to the site.
 
  All of the above total 309 million members or about 38.6 percent of Facebook's 1 billion worldwide members.
  

    [335]
   

  As of March 2013, Facebook reported having 1.11 billion monthly active users, globally.
  

    [336]
   


  In regards to Facebook's mobile usage, per an analyst report in early 2013, there are 192 million Android users, 147 million iPhone users, 48 million iPad users and 56 million messenger users, and a total of 604 million mobile Facebook users.
  

    [337]
   

  In January 2016, Facebook Messenger hits 800 million users.
  

    [338]
   


      Facebook popularity. Active users of Facebook increased from just a million in 2004 to over 750 million in 2011.

  On April 21, 2011,
  
   Greenpeace
  
  released a report showing that of the top ten big brands in cloud computing, Facebook was most reliant on coal for electricity for its data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase.
  
   Phil Radford
  
  of Greenpeace said "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today."
  

    [341]
   

  On December 15, 2011, Greenpeace and Facebook announced together that Facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations. Marcy Scott Lynn, of Facebook's sustainability program, said it looked forward "to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable" and that the company is "working with Greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer."

  In May 2011 emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about
  
   Google's privacy policies
  
  ; however it was later discovered that
  
   PR
  
  giant
  
   Burson-Marsteller
  
  was paid for the emails by Facebook.

  Following media reports about
  
   PRISM
  
  , NSA's massive electronic
  
   surveillance program
  
  , in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Facebook. According to leaks of said program, Facebook joined the PRISM program in 2009.

  A 2011 study in the online journal
  

    First Monday
   

  , examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook's policy banning young visitors. This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998
  
   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
  
  , which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In other jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, "Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join." The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation, or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.

  In November 2011, several Facebook users in
  
   Bangalore
  
  , India reported that their accounts had been hacked and their profile pictures replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual content, and it was reported that more than 200,000 accounts were affected. Facebook described the reports as inaccurate, and Bangalore police speculated that the stories may have been rumors spread by Facebook's competitors.

    [348]
   


  On August 19, 2013, it was reported that a Facebook user from
  
   Yatta
  
  ,
  
   West Bank
  


    [349]
   



    [350]
   

  Khalil Shreateh had found a
  
   bug
  
  that allowed him to post material to other users' Facebook Walls. Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a US$500 fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that "this was not a bug" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating "Sorry for breaking your privacy … but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. Facebook refused to pay out the bounty to Shreateh, stating that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their
  
   terms of service
  
  policies and therefore "could not be paid." Facebook also noted that in Shreateh's initial reports, he had failed to provide technical details for Facebook to act on the bug.

  On August 22, 2013,
  
   Yahoo News
  
  reported that
  
   Marc Maiffret
  
  , a chief technology officer of the
  
   cybersecurity
  
  firm
  
   BeyondTrust
  
  , is prompting
  
   hackers
  
  to support in raising a $10,000 reward for Khalil Shreateh. On August 20, Maiffret stated that he had already raised $9,000 in his efforts, including the $2,000 he himself contributed. He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation. Stated Maiffret, "He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It's something that might help him out in a big way." Facebook representatives have since responded, "We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users." Facebook representatives also claimed they'd paid out over $1 million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past.

  A 2013 study examined the reasons users eventually quit the site. It found the most common reasons were privacy concerns (48%), general dissatisfaction with Facebook (14%), negative aspects regarding Facebook friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to Facebook (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.

  Following the release of the Facebook
  
   iPhone app
  
  "Paper" at the beginning of February 2014, developer company
  
   FiftyThree
  
  sent a correspondence to the social media company regarding its own app, also entitled Paper and trademarked in 2012, asking Facebook to cease using an app name that they consider their own. In response, Facebook stated that it will continue to use the Paper title but conceded that it should have informed FiftyThree at an earlier point in time. FiftyThree articulated its desired outcome in a blog post: "There's a simple fix here. We think Facebook can apply the same degree of thought they put into the app into building a brand name of their own. An app about stories shouldn't start with someone else's story. Facebook should stop using our brand name."

  In March 2010, Judge Richard Seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in
  

    Lane v. Facebook, Inc.
   



    [357]
   

  This lawsuit charged that user's private information was being posted on Facebook without consent using Facebook's Beacon program.
 


    Fraley v. Facebook, Inc.
   

  was a class-action case that alleged that Facebook had misappropriated users' names and likenesses in advertisements.
  

    [358]
   

  The case settled in 2013,
  

    [358]
   

  with checks to class members mailed in November 2016.

  Academic and Facebook researchers have collaborated to test if the messages people see on Facebook can influence their behavior. For instance, in "A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence And Political Mobilization," during the 2010 elections, Facebook users were given the opportunity to "tell your friends you voted" by clicking on an "I voted" button. Users were 2% more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted.

  Much more controversially, a 2014 study of "Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks" manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by 689,000 Facebook users.
  

    [361]
   

  The researchers concluded that they had found "some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network, [though] the effect sizes from the manipulations are small."
  

    [362]
   


  Unlike the "I voted" study, which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns, this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods/claims. As controversy about the study grew, Adam Kramer, a lead author of both studies and member of the Facebook data team, defended the work in a
  
   Facebook update
  
  . A few days later, Sheryl Sandburg, Facebook's COO, made a statement while traveling abroad. While at an Indian Chambers of Commerce event in New Delhi she stated that "This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was. It was poorly communicated and for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you."
  

    [363]
   


  Shortly thereafter, on July 3, 2014,
  

    USA Today
   

  reported that the privacy watchdog group
  
   Electronic Privacy Information Center
  
  (EPIC) had filed a formal complaint with the
  
   Federal Trade Commission
  
  claiming that Facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent. In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: "At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers."
  

    [364]
   


  Beyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study's findings. John Grohol, writing for
  
   Psych Central
  
  , argued that despite its title and claims of "
  
   emotional contagion
  
  ," this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called "Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet "I am not happy" would be scored as positive: "Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers." Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the
  
   effect size
  
  of the findings are little more than a "statistical blip."
 
   Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%—that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!!—decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know how many words you'd have to read or write before you've written one less negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands.
   

     [365]
    


  The consequences of the controversy are pending (be it FTC or court proceedings) but it did prompt an "
  
   Editorial Expression of Concern
  
  " from its publisher, the
  
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  
  , as well as an blog posting from
  
   OkCupid
  
  that "
  
   We experiment on human beings
  
  !" In September 2014, law professor James Grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were "illegal, immoral, and mood-altering" and filed notices with the Maryland Attorney General and Cornell Institutional Review Board.
  

    [366]
   


  In the UK, the study was also criticised by the
  
   British Psychological Society
  
  which said, in a letter to
  

    The Guardian
   

  , "There has undoubtedly been some degree of harm caused, with many individuals affected by increased levels of negative emotion, with consequent potential economic costs, increase in possible mental health problems and burden on health services. The so-called 'positive' manipulation is also potentially harmful."
  

    [367]
   


  Facebook has a
  
   real-name system
  
  policy for
  
   user profiles
  
  . The real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."
  

    [368]
   



    [369]
   

  Facebook's real-name system does not allow adopted names or
  
   pseudonyms
  
  , and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users, until the user provides identification indicating the name. Facebook representatives have described these incidents as very rare.
  

    [370]
   

  A user claimed responsibility via the
  
   anonymous
  

   Android
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  app
  
   Secret
  
  for reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the
  
   stage names
  
  of
  
   drag queens
  
  .
  

    [371]
   

  On October 1, 2014,
  
   Chris Cox
  
  , Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology: "In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were."
  

    [372]
   


  On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release
  

    [373]
   

  that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse-victims.
  

    [374]
   

  The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.
  

    [375]
   


  In February 2016,
  
   TRAI
  
  ruled against differential data pricing for limited services from mobile phone operators effectively ending zero-rating platforms in India. Zero rating provides access to limited number of websites for no charge to the end user. Net-neutrality supporters from India (
  
   SaveTheInternet.in
  
  ) brought out the negative implications of Facebook Free Basic program and spread awareness to the public.
  

    [376]
   

  Facebook's Free Basics program
  

    [377]
   

  was a collaboration with
  
   Reliance Communications
  
  to launch Free Basics in India. The TRAI ruling against differential pricing marked the end of Free Basics in India.
  

    [378]
   


  Earlier, Facebook had spent $44 million USD in advertising and it implored all of its Indian users to send an email to the Telecom Regulatory Authority to support its program.
  

    [379]
   

  TRAI later asked Facebook to provide specific responses from the supporters of Free Basics.

  On March 27, 2016, following a
  
   bombing in Lahore
  
  , Pakistan, Facebook activated its "Safety Check" feature, which allows people to let friends and loved ones know they are okay following a crisis or natural disaster, to people who were never in danger, or even close to the Pakistan explosion. Some users as far as the US, UK and Egypt received notifications asking if they were okay.

  On July 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, asking for a court order to enforce an administrative summons issued to Facebook, Inc., under
  
   Internal Revenue Code
  
  section 7602,
  

    [384]
   

  in connection with an
  
   Internal Revenue Service
  
  examination of Facebook's year 2010 U.S. Federal income tax return.

  In July 2016, a civil action for $1 billion in damages was filed in the
  
   United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
  
  on behalf of the victims and family members of four Israeli-Americans and one US citizen killed since June 2014 by
  
   Hamas
  
  terrorists who had used Facebook. The government of the United States has designated Hamas as a
  
   Foreign Terrorist Organization
  
  and the suit alleges that Facebook provided Hamas with "material support" in violation of
  
   US Anti-Terrorism laws
  
  .

  At least one adolescent accused of
  
   serial rape
  
  was described as using Facebook to make friends of his victims.
  

    [389]
   


  In another separate incident, a man with special needs was kidnapped and tortured by four suspects, with the assault live streamed over Facebook. The incident has been ruled a hate crime
  

    [390]
   



    [391]
   



    [392]
   

  and has received international coverage.
  

    [393]
   

  According to
  
   CNN
  
  and
  

    The Guardian
   

  , Facebook faced criticism for not having removed the torture video quickly enough.

  In March 2017 a BBC investigation found that there were groups on Facebook dedicated to sharing and discussing child pornography. Most images were not taken down on request, and when the BBC sent some of the questionable images to Facebook for comment, Facebook reported the BBC to the police.
  

    [396]
   



    [397]
   


  In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.
  

    [398]
   

  The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an "influencers' summit" in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for
  

    True Blood
   

  ,
  

    American Idol
   

  , and
  

    Top Gear
   

  .
  

    [399]
   

  News and media outlets such as
  
   The Washington Post
  
  ,
  

    [400]
   


   Financial Times
  


    [401]
   

  and ABC News
  

    [402]
   

  have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles. In 2012, the beauty pageant
  
   Miss Sri Lanka Online
  
  was run exclusively using Facebook.
  

    [403]
   


  Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. Facebook allows people using computers or mobile phones to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It has reunited lost family members and friends.
  

    [404]
   



    [405]
   

  It allows users to trade ideas, stay informed with local or global developments, and unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through open, closed and private groups and other pages.
  

    [406]
   



    [407]
   


  Facebook's social impact has also changed how people communicate. Rather than having to reply to others through email, Facebook allows users to broadcast or share content to others, and thereby to engage others or be engaged with others' posts.
  

    [408]
   


  Facebook has been successful and more socially impactful than many other social media sites. David Kirkpatrick, technology journalist and author of
  
   The Facebook Effect
  
  , believes that Facebook is structured in a way that is not easily replaceable. He challenges users to consider how difficult it would be to move all the relationships and photos to an alternative. Facebook has let people participate in an atmosphere with the "over the backyard fence quality" of a small town, despite the move to larger cities.
  

    [409]
   

  As per
  
   Pew Research Center
  
  survey, 44 percent of the overall population gets news through Facebook.
  

    [410]
   


  Recent studies have shown that Facebook causes negative effects on
  
   self-esteem
  
  by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving to be the largest resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by
  
   Utah Valley University
  
  found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in the amount of time spent on Facebook.
  

    [411]
   



    [412]
   



    [413]
   

  In addition, a recent study from Pace University showed that the more frequently users update their status on Facebook, the lower their self esteeem.
  

    [414]
   


  According to professor of psychology Susan Krauss Whitbourne, although Facebook has an upside of friending people, there is also the downside of having someone
  
   unfriend
  
  or reject another person.
  

    [415]
   

  Whitbourne refers to unfriended persons on Facebook as victims of
  
   estrangement
  
  .
  

    [415]
   

  Unfriending someone is seldom a mutual decision and the person often does not know he has been unfriended.
  

    [415]
   


  One explanation is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people feel the need to share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to
  
   cognitive dissonance
  
  . Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.
  

    [416]
   


  In February 2008, a Facebook group called "One Million Voices Against FARC" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of
  
   Colombians
  
  marched in protest against the
  
   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
  
  , better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name).
  

    [417]
   

  In August 2010, one of
  
   North Korea
  
  's official government websites and the official news agency of the country,
  
   Uriminzokkiri
  
  , joined Facebook.
  

    [418]
   


  During the
  
   Arab Spring
  
  many journalists made claims that Facebook played a major role in generating the
  
   2011 Egyptian revolution
  
  .
  

    [419]
   



    [420]
   

  On January 14, the Facebook page of "We are all khaled Said" was started by Wael Ghoniem Create Event to invite the Egyptian people to "peaceful demonstrations" on January 25. According to
  
   Mashable
  
  ,
  
   [

  in Tunisia and Egpyt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting all protesters and led the Egyptian government of Prime Minister
  
   Nazif
  
  to ban Facebook, Twitter and another websites on January 26
  

    [421]
   

  then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt at midnight January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President
  
   Mubarak
  
  to resign.
 
  In
  
   Bahrain uprising
  
  which started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime as well as regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old girl named
  
   Ayat Al Qurmezi
  
  was identified as a protester using Facebook, taken from her home by masked commandos and put in prison.
  

    [422]
   


  In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the
  
   Federal Election Commission
  
  to form a
  
   political action committee
  
  under the name
  
   FB PAC
  
  .
  

    [423]
   

  In an email to
  

    The Hill
   

  , a spokesman for Facebook said "Facebook
  
   Political Action Committee
  
  will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected."

  During the Syrian civil war, the
  
   YPG
  
  , a libertarian army for
  
   Rojava
  
  has recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against
  
   ISIL
  
  .
  

    [425]
   



    [426]
   

  Dozens have joined its ranks for various reasons from religious to ideological. The Facebook page's name "The Lions of Rojava" comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as "A lion is a lion, whether it's a female or a male", reflecting the organization's feminist ideology.
  

    [427]
   


  Facebook's role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the
  
   New Hampshire primary
  
  , when Facebook teamed up with
  
   ABC
  
  and
  
   Saint Anselm College
  
  to allow users to give live feedback about the "back to back" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.
  

    [428]
   



    [429]
   



    [430]
   

  Facebook users took part in debate groups organized around specific topics, register to vote, and message questions.
  

    [431]
   


  Over a million people installed the Facebook application "US Politics on Facebook" in order to take part, and the application measured users' responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates.
  

    [432]
   

  This debate showed the broader community what many young students had already experienced: Facebook as a popular and powerful new way to interact and voice opinions. A poll by
  
   CBS News
  
  ,
  
   UWIRE
  
  and
  

    The Chronicle of Higher Education
   

  claimed to illustrate how the "Facebook effect" has affected youth voting rates, support by youth of political candidates, and general involvement by the youth population in the 2008 election.
  

    [433]
   


  The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message among much larger audiences than they had previously reached.

  Facebook is having an impact on local government as well.
  
   Justin Smith
  
  , a Colorado sheriff uses Facebook to disseminate his ideas on matters relating to local, state, and national concerns. He also publicizes crimes, particularly those that his department solves. He has seven thousand followers on the social medium, considered a large number. Smith said that he rarely goes out in public "when I don't get feedback from folks. … Facebook is an interesting tool because I think it holds candidates and elected officials more accountable. Voters know where someone stands."
  

    [436]
   


  As American political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.
  

    [437]
   


  In many countries the social networking sites and mobile apps have been blocked temporarily or permanently, including
  
   China
