  The
  

    iMac
   

  is a series of
  
   Macintosh
  

   desktop computers
  
  offered by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  The current Apple iMac features either an
  
   Intel Core
  
  i5 or Core i7 processor, Intel Iris,
  
   Nvidia
  

   GeForce 700 Series
  
  , or AMD Radeon R9 M200 Series graphics cards, and a choice of either a 21.5" or 27"
  
   LED-LCD
  
  display.
 
  Previous iMac models featured either a white
  
   polycarbonate
  
  enclosure or an
  
   aluminium
  
  enclosure. The October 2009 iMac model featured a
  
   unibody aluminium
  
  enclosure, a version of which can still be seen on the current model. The current iMacs released in October 2012 also feature a much thinner display, with the edge measuring just 5 mm.

  At the
  
   Macworld Conference and Expo
  
  on January 10, 2006,
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  announced that the new iMac would be the first
  
   Macintosh
  
  to use an
  
   Intel
  
  CPU, the
  
   Core Duo
  
  . The introduction of the new iMac along with the Intel-based
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  signaled the start of a six-month transition from
  
   PowerPC
  
  to
  
   Intel
  
  processors.
 
  The features, price, and case design remained unchanged from the
  
   iMac G5
  
  . The processor speed, however, according to tests run by Apple using SPEC,
  

    [2]
   

  was declared to be two to three times faster than the iMac G5.
 
  Alongside the
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  , the iMac Core Duo represents Apple's first computer to feature Intel processors instead of
  
   PowerPC processors
  
  ,
  
   a transition
  
  that completed in November 2006. Since the introduction of the iMac Core Duo, other lines have followed, including the introduction of the Intel Core-powered
  
   Mac mini
  
  on February 28, 2006, the
  
   MacBook
  
  consumer line of laptop computers on May 16, 2006, the
  
   Mac Pro
  
  on August 7, 2006, and the
  
   Xserve
  
  in November 2006, completing the Macintosh family transition to Intel processors.
 
  In early February 2006,
  
   Apple
  
  confirmed reports of video display problems on the new Intel-based iMacs. When playing video on Apple's
  
   Front Row
  
  media browser, some 20-inch iMacs (those built-to-order with upgraded video cards) showed random horizontal lines, ghosting, video tearing and other problems. The problem was fixed with a software update.
 
  In late 2006, Apple introduced a new version of the iMac which included a
  
   Core 2 Duo
  
  chip and a lower price. Apple added a new 24-inch model with IPS-display and a resolution of 1920 × 1200 (
  
   WUXGA
  
  ), making it the first iMac to be able to display
  
   1080p
  
  content in its full resolution, and a
  
   VESA
  

   Flat Display Mounting Interface
  
  . Except for the 17-inch 1.83 GHz processor model, this version also included an
  
   802.11n
  
  draft card.

  In August 2007, Apple introduced a complete redesign of the iMac, featuring an aluminum, glass and plastic enclosure. There is only one visible screw on the entire computer, located at the base of the iMac for accessing the memory slots. It has a black, plastic backplate that is not user removable. The 17-inch model was completely removed from the lineup.
 
  In March 2009, Apple released a minor refresh of the iMac line. Changes included a fourth
  
   USB
  
  port, removal of the
  
   FireWire 400
  
  port, and a slightly redesigned base. The exterior design was almost identical to the older Intel-based iMacs. The models were one 20-inch configuration and three 24-inch configurations (instead of two at each screen size as before).

  Apple doubled the default RAM and hard-disk size on all models, moving the RAM to the DDR2
  

    [14]
   

  specification. This revision also introduced a new, smaller, and more compact
  
   Apple Keyboard
  
  that excluded the
  
   numeric keypad
  
  and
  
   forward delete key
  
  in favor of the
  
   fn
  
  +
  
   Delete
  
  keys shortcut by default.
  

    [13]
   

  Users could, however, replace
  
   this version
  
  with a
  
   more traditional, full-size model
  

   with
  
  a
  
   numeric keypad
  
  by requesting Apple to
  
   build their machine to order
  
  through its
  
   online store
  
  .
 
  In October 2009, a 16:9
  
   aspect ratio
  
  screen was introduced in 21.5" and 27" models, replacing the 20" and 24" 16:10 aspect ratio screens of the previous generation. The back is now a continuation of the aluminum body from the front and sides instead of a separate plastic backplate. Video card options entirely switched to
  
   AMD
  
  , save for the standard onboard
  
   Nvidia
  
  card in the base model. The iMac's processor selection saw a significant increase.
 
  Default
  
   RAM
  
  has also been increased across the iMac range. With the advent of the larger screens, Apple doubled the number of memory slots from two to four. Consequently, the maximum memory capacity was also doubled (to 16 GB), and for Intel Core i-series (27-inch), quadrupled, to 32 GB.
 
  In October 2012, a new iMac model was introduced that featured a considerably smaller body depth than the previous models, measuring 5mm at its thinnest point. This was partly achieved by using a process called Full lamination. The display and glass are laminated together eliminating a 2 mm gap between them. The 21.5 in and 27 in screens remained at their previous resolutions, 1920×1080 and 2560×1440 respectively.
 
  As with the 2009 model, memory has been upgraded; the standard specification is now 8 GB, with the 21.5 in model supporting up to 16 GB and the 27 in model supporting up to 32 GB. It was reported that the 21.5 in iMac would have non-replaceable soldered memory similar to the
  
   MacBook Air
  
  and
  
   Retina display MacBook Pro
  


    [29]
   

  though tear-downs show that it uses removable memory but accessing the modules requires ungluing the screen and removing the logic board.
  

    [30]
   

  The 27 in version features an access port to upgrade memory without disassembling the display.
  

    [31]
   

  Apple also upgraded the computers' processors, using Intel's
  
   Ivy Bridge
  

   microarchitecture
  
  -based Core i5 and Core i7 microprocessors.
 
  Video cards are now
  
   Nvidia
  
  as standard. USB 3.0 ports are now included for the first time. The 2012 iMac also features the option of a
  
   Fusion Drive
  
  which combines an
  
   SSD
  
  and a conventional
  
   HDD
  
  to create more efficient and faster storage. Apple also removed the built-in optical drive starting with this iMac generation.
 
  On March 5, 2013, Apple quietly announced an education-only version of the iMac, with less powerful specs for a cheaper price. It includes a 3.3 GHz dual-core Intel i3 processor, 4 GB of memory, a 500 GB hard drive and Intel HD Graphics 4000, retailing for US$1099, $200 cheaper than the base-level consumer iMac.

  On September 24, 2013, the 2012 iMac model was updated with 4th-generation Intel Haswell processors and Nvidia 7xx series GPU, promising up to 1.4x improvements in performance. It also has 802.11ac Wi-Fi, which is capable of reaching speeds up to 1300 Mbit/s and PCIe-based flash storage, offering up to 1.5x the performance of previous-generation (Ivy Bridge) iMacs. This applies to both the Fusion Drive and pure-SSD options.
 
  A
  
   Retina Display
  
  "5K" model with a resolution of 5120 × 2880 was introduced alongside the previous year's models during a keynote on October 16, 2014. This 27-inch model was given faster Haswell processors and its two Thunderbolt ports were updated to Thunderbolt 2. Secondary storage was also upgraded to a 1TB Fusion drive as standard and video options changed over to AMD Radeon R9 M290X and M295X. A 21.5-inch "4K" model with a resolution of 4096 × 2304 was released on October 13, 2015.
