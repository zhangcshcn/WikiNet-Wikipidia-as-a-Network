   Xcode
  
  is an
  
   integrated development environment
  
  for
  
   macOS
  
  containing a suite of
  
   software development
  
  tools developed by
  
   Apple
  
  for developing software for macOS,
  
   iOS
  
  ,
  
   watchOS
  
  and
  
   tvOS
  
  . First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 8 and is available via the
  
   Mac App Store
  
  free of charge for
  
   OS X El Capitan
  
  and
  
   macOS Sierra
  
  users.

   Registered developers
  
  can download
  
   preview releases
  
  and prior versions of the suite through the
  
   Apple Developer
  
  website.
  

    [3]
   

  However, Apple recently made a beta version of version 8.0 of the software available to those of the public with Apple Developer accounts.

  Xcode supports
  
   source code
  
  for the
  
   programming languages
  

   C
  
  ,
  
   C++
  
  ,
  
   Objective-C
  
  ,
  
   Objective-C++
  
  ,
  
   Java
  
  ,
  
   AppleScript
  
  ,
  
   Python
  
  ,
  
   Ruby
  
  ,
  
   ResEdit
  
  (Rez), and
  
   Swift
  
  , with a variety of programming models, including but not limited to
  
   Cocoa
  
  ,
  
   Carbon
  
  , and Java. Third parties have added support for
  
   GNU Pascal
  
  ,
  

    [5]
   


   Free Pascal
  
  ,
  

    [6]
   


   Ada
  
  ,
  

    [7]
   


   C#
  
  ,
  

    [8]
   


   Perl
  
  ,
  

    [9]
   

  and
  
   D
  
  .
 
  Thanks to the
  
   Mach-O
  
  executable format, which allows
  

    fat binary
   

  files, containing code for multiple architectures, Xcode can build
  
   universal binary
  
  files, which allow software to run on both
  
   PowerPC
  
  and
  
   Intel
  
  -based (
  
   x86
  
  )
  
   platforms
  
  and that can include both
  
   32-bit
  
  and
  
   64-bit
  
  code for both architectures. Using the
  
   iOS SDK
  
  , Xcode can also be used to compile and debug applications for
  
   iOS
  
  that run on
  
   ARM architecture
  
  processors.
 
  Xcode includes the GUI tool
  
   Instruments
  
  , which runs atop a dynamic tracing framework,
  
   DTrace
  
  , created by
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  and released as part of
  
   OpenSolaris
  
  .
 
  The main application of the suite is the
  
   integrated development environment
  
  (IDE), also named Xcode. The Xcode suite includes most of Apple's developer documentation, and built-in
  
   Interface Builder
  
  , an application used to construct
  
   graphical user interfaces
  
  .
 
  Up to Xcode 4.1, the Xcode suite included a modified version of the
  
   GNU Compiler Collection
  
  . In Xcode 3.1 up to Xcode 4.6.3, it included the LLVM-GCC compiler, with front ends from the
  
   GNU Compiler Collection
  
  and a code generator based on
  
   LLVM
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  In Xcode 3.2 and later, it included the
  
   Clang
  
  C/C++/Objective-C compiler, with newly-written front ends and a code generator based on LLVM, and the Clang
  
   static analyzer
  
  .
  

    [11]
   

  Starting with Xcode 4.2, the Clang compiler became the default compiler,
  

    [12]
   

  Starting with Xcode 5.0, Clang was the only compiler provided.
 
  Up to Xcode 4.6.3, the Xcode suite used the
  
   GNU Debugger
  
  (GDB) as the
  
   back-end
  
  for the IDE's
  
   debugger
  
  . Starting with Xcode 4.3, the
  
   LLDB debugger
  
  was also provided; starting with Xcode 4.5 LLDB replaced GDB as the default back-end for the IDE's debugger.
  

    [13]
   

  Starting with Xcode 5.0, GDB was no longer supplied.
  

    [14]
   


  Formerly, Xcode supported distributing a product build process over multiple systems. One technology involved was named
  
   Shared Workgroup Build
  
  , which used the
  
   Bonjour protocol
  
  to automatically discover systems providing compiler services, and a modified version of the free software product
  
   distcc
  
  to facilitate the distribution of workloads. Earlier versions of Xcode provided a system named
  
   Dedicated Network Builds
  
  . These features are absent in the supported versions of Xcode.
 
  Xcode also includes Apple's
  
   WebObjects
  
  tools and frameworks for building Java web applications and web services (formerly sold as a separate product). As of Xcode 3.0, Apple dropped
  

    [15]
   

  WebObjects development inside Xcode; WOLips
  

    [16]
   

  should be used instead. Xcode 3 still includes the WebObjects frameworks.
 
  Xcode 1.0 was released in fall 2003. Xcode 1.0 was based on
  
   Project Builder
  
  , but had an updated
  
   user interface
  
  (UI), ZeroLink, Fix & Continue, distributed build support, and Code Sense indexing.
 
  The next significant release, Xcode 1.5, had better code completion and an improved debugger.
 
  Xcode 2.0 was released with
  
   Mac OS X v10.4
  
  "Tiger". It included the
  
   Quartz Composer
  
  visual programming language, better Code Sense indexing for Java, and
  
   Ant
  
  support. It also included the Apple Reference Library tool, which allows searching and reading online documentation from Appleâ€™s website and documentation installed on a local computer.
 
  Xcode 2.1 could create
  
   universal binary
  
  files. It supported shared
  
   precompiled headers
  
  , unit testing targets, conditional breakpoints, and watchpoints. It also had better dependency analysis.
 
  The final version of Xcode for
  
   Mac OS X v10.4
  
  was 2.5.
 
  Xcode 3.0 was released with
  
   Mac OS X v10.5
  
  "Leopard". Notable changes since 2.1 include
  

    [17]
   

  the
  
   DTrace
  
  debugging tool (now named
  
   Instruments
  
  ), refactoring support, context-sensitive documentation, and
  
   Objective-C
  
  2.0 with
  
   garbage collection
  
  . It also supports Project Snapshots, which provide a basic form of version control; Message Bubbles, which show build errors debug values alongside code; and building four-architecture fat binaries (32 and 64-bit Intel and PowerPC).
 
  Xcode 3.1 was an update release of the developer tools for Mac OS X, and was the same version included with the iPhone SDK. It could target non-Mac OS X platforms, including iPhone OS 2.0. It included the GCC 4.2 and
  
   LLVM
  
  GCC 4.2 compilers. Another new feature since Xcode 3.0 is that Xcode's SCM support now includes Subversion 1.5.
 
  Xcode 3.2 was released with
  
   Mac OS X v10.6
  
  "Snow Leopard" and installs on no earlier version of OS X. It supports
  
   static program analysis
  
  , among other features. It also drops official support for targeting versions earlier than iPhone OS 3.0. But it is still possible to target older versions, and the simulator supports iPhone OS 2.0 through 3.1. Also,
  
   Java
  
  support is "exiled" in 3.2 to the organizer.
  

    [18]
   


  Xcode 3.2.6 is the last version that can be downloaded for free for users of
  
   Mac OS X v10.6
  
  . Downloading it requires a free registration at Apple's developer site.
 
  In June 2010, at the
  
   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  version 4 of Xcode was announced during the Developer Tools State of the Union address. Version 4 of the developer tools consolidates the Xcode editing tools and Interface Builder into one application, among other enhancements.
  

    [19]
   



    [20]
   

  Apple released the final version of Xcode 4.0 on March 9, 2011. The software was made available for free to all registered members of the $99 per year Mac Developer program and the $99 per year iOS Developer program. It was also sold for $4.99 to non-members on the
  
   Mac App Store
  
  (no longer available). Xcode 4.0 drops support for many older systems, including all PowerPC development and
  
   software development kits
  
  (SDKs) for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, and all iOS SDKs older than 4.3. The deployment target can still be set to produce binaries for those older platforms, but for Mac OS platforms, one is then limited to creating
  
   x86
  
  and
  
   x86-64
  
  binaries. Later, Xcode was free to the general public. Before version 4.1, Xcode cost $4.99.
  

    [21]
   


  Xcode 4.1 was made available for free on July 20, 2011 (the day of
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  's release) to all users of Mac OS X Lion on the Mac App Store. On August 29, 2011, Xcode 4.1 was made available for Mac OS X Snow Leopard for members of the paid Mac or iOS developer programs.
  

    [22]
   

  Xcode 4.1 was the last version to include
  
   GNU Compiler Collection
  
  (GCC) instead of only
  
   LLVM
  
  GCC or
  
   Clang
  
  .
 
  On October 12, 2011, Xcode 4.2 was released concurrently with the release of
  
   iOS
  
  5.0, and it included many more and improved features, such as storyboarding and
  
   automatic reference counting (ARC)
  
  .
  

    [12]
   

  Xcode 4.2 is the last version to support
  
   Mac OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard"
  
  , but is only available to registered developers with paid accounts; without a paid account, 3.2.6 is the latest download that appears for Snow Leopard.
  

    [23]
   


  Xcode 4.3, released on February 16, 2012, is distributed as one application bundle, Xcode.app, installed from the Mac App Store. Xcode 4.3 reorganizes the Xcode menu to include development tools.
  

    [24]
   

  Xcode 4.3.1 was released on March 7, 2012 to add support for iOS 5.1.
  

    [25]
   

  Xcode 4.3.2 was released on March 22, 2012 with enhancements to the iOS Simulator and a suggested move to the LLDB debugger versus the GDB debugger (which appear to be undocumented changes).

  Xcode 4.3.3, released in May 2012, featured an updated SDK for
  
   Mac OS X 10.7.4 "Lion"
  
  and a few bug fixes.
  

    [26]
   


  Xcode 4.4 was released on July 25, 2012.
  

    [27]
   

  It runs on both
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  (10.7) and
  
   OS X Mountain Lion
  
  (10.8) and is the first version of Xcode to contain the
  
   OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion"
  
  SDK. Xcode 4.4 includes support for automatic synthesizing of declared properties, new
  
   Objective-C
  
  features such as literal syntax and subscripting, improved localization, and more.
  

    [28]
   

  On August 7, 2012, Xcode 4.4.1 was released with a few bug fixes.
 
  On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 and Xcode 4.5 were released. Xcode added support for iOS 6 and the 4-inch
  
   Retina Display
  
  on
  
   iPhone 5
  
  and
  
   iPod touch
  
  5th generation. It also brought some new
  
   Objective-C
  
  features to iOS, simplified localization, and added auto-layout support for iOS.
  

    [13]
   

  On October 3, 2012, Xcode 4.5.1 was released with bug fixes and stability improvements.
  

    [2]
   

  Less than a month later, Xcode 4.5.2 was released, with support for
  
   iPad Mini
  
  and
  
   iPad
  
  with Retina Display, and bug fixes and stability improvements.
 
  On January 28, 2013,
  
   iOS
  
  6.1 and Xcode 4.6 were released.
 
  In June 2013, at the
  
   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  , version 5 of Xcode was announced.
  

    [29]
   

  On September 18, 2013 Xcode 5.0 was released. It added support for iOS 7 SDK, with always support of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion SDK but not the support of OS X 10.9 Mavericks SDK. This latest was only included in the betas version. It also added a version of
  
   Clang
  
  generating 64-bit ARM code for iOS 7. Apple removed support for building garbage collected Cocoa binaries in Xcode 5.1.
  

    [30]
   


  On June 2, 2014 at the World Wide Developers Conference, Apple announced version 6 of Xcode. Features include
  
   Playgrounds
  
  , live debugging tools, and a new programming language named
  
   Swift
  
  .
