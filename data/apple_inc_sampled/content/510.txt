  The
  
   IBM System x
  

   computers
  
  formed a sub-brand of
  
   International Business Machines
  
  (IBM's)
  
   System
  
  brand
  
   servers
  
  , focusing on x86 processor equipped servers. (the other
  
   System
  
  sub-brands having the names
  
   IBM Power Systems
  
  ,
  
   IBM System z
  
  and
  
   IBM System Storage
  
  ). In addition,
  
   IBM System x
  
  was the main component of the
  
   IBM System Cluster 1350
  
  solution.
 
  The division has been sold to
  
   Lenovo
  
  , effective October 1st 2014.

  Starting out as
  
   IBM PC Server
  
  , rebranded
  
   Netfinity
  
  , then
  
   eServer xSeries
  
  and now
  
   System x
  
  , these servers are distinguished by being based on
  
   off-the-shelf
  

   x86
  

   CPUs
  
  ; IBM positions them as their "low end" or "entry" offering. Previously IBM servers based on
  
   AMD
  

   Opteron
  
  CPUs did not share the
  
   xSeries
  
  brand; instead they fell directly under the
  
   e
  
  Server umbrella. However, current AMD Opteron-based servers fall under the
  
   System x
  
  brand.
 
  Not to be confused with a different IBM product with a similar name,
  
   NetFinity
  
  (notice the capital F).
 
  The numbering scheme started off similar to that of the IBM PC Servers, but additional ranges were added, like the entry-level 1000 model later on. Models ending with an R, are rack-mount.
 
  Some Netfinity servers used IBM's
  
   C2T
  
  cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.
 
  Many xSeries servers used IBM's
  
   C2T
  
  cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.
 
  For marketing reasons the AMD processor based e325, e326 and e326m and the BladeCenter which supports non-Intel processor products were not branded xSeries, but were instead placed directly under the eServer brand. The xSeries brand was limited to only Intel-based server products.
 
  From a numbering perspective the AMD servers did fit into the xSeries range, under the similar x335 and x336 Intel processor products. These numbers were not re-used in the xSeries range to prevent confusion.
 


  Lenovo also had and still has its own ThinkServer family of Intel servers. This family is technically less advanced than System x.
 
  2nd digit increments to show capability
 
  3rd digit is a 0 for tower models, and 5 for rack-mount
 
  4th digit is a 0 for Intel processors, and 5 for AMD Opteron.
 
  Models with a T at the end are meant for Telco purposes.
 
  System x iDataPlex was used by many
  
   TOP500
  
  supercomputers, including
  
   SuperMUC
  
  and Stampede. Other smaller installations included
  
   SciNet Consortium
  
  's General Purpose Cluster
