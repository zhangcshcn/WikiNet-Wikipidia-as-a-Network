   Reed College
  
  is a private
  
   liberal arts college
  
  in southeast
  
   Portland
  
  in the
  
   U.S. state
  
  of
  
   Oregon
  
  . Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus in Portland's
  
   Eastmoreland
  
  neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the
  
   Tudor
  
  -
  
   Gothic
  
  style,
  

    [4]
   

  and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center.
 
  Reed is known for its mandatory freshman
  
   humanities
  
  program, required senior-year thesis, and the unusually high proportion of graduates who go on to earn doctorates and other postgraduate degrees. The college has many prominent
  
   alumni
  
  , including over 90
  
   Fulbright Scholars
  
  , 67
  
   Watson Fellows
  
  , 3
  
   MacArthur Fellows
  
  , and 32
  
   Rhodes Scholars
  
  —the second-highest number of any liberal arts college.

  The
  
   Reed Institute
  
  (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908, and held its first classes in 1911. Reed is named for Oregon pioneers
  
   Simeon Gannett Reed
  
  (1830–1895) and
  
   Amanda Reed
  
  (died 1904).
  

    [8]
   

  Simeon was an entrepreneur in trade on the
  
   Columbia River
  
  . Unitarian minister
  
   Thomas Lamb Eliot
  
  , who knew the Reeds from the church choir, is credited with convincing Reed of the need for "a lasting legacy, a 'Reed Institute of Lectures,' and joked it would 'need a mine to run it.' "
  

    [9]
   

  Reed's will suggested his wife could "devote some portion of my estate to benevolent objects, or to the cultivation, illustration, or development of the fine arts in the city of Portland, or to some other suitable purpose, which shall be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city and to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants".
  

    [10]
   

  Reed's first president (1910–1919) was
  
   William Trufant Foster
  
  , a former professor at
  
   Bates College
  
  and
  
   Bowdoin College
  
  in
  
   Maine
  
  .
 
  Contrary to popular belief, the college did not grow out of student revolts and experimentation, but out of a desire to provide a "more flexible, individualized approach to a rigorous liberal arts education".
  

    [11]
   

  Founded explicitly in reaction to the "prevailing model of East Coast,
  
   Ivy League
  
  education", the college's lack of
  
   varsity athletics
  
  ,
  
   fraternities
  
  , and exclusive social clubs – as well as its
  
   coeducational
  
  ,
  
   nonsectarian
  
  , and
  
   egalitarian
  
  status – gave way to an intensely academic and intellectual college whose purpose was to devote itself to "the life of the mind", that life being understood primarily as the academic life.
  

    [12]
   


  The college has a reputation for
  
   political liberalism
  
  .
  

    [13]
   


  According to
  
   sociologist
  
  Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States,
  

    [14]
   

  featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110, an intensive introduction to the
  
   Classics
  
  , covering ancient
  
   Greece
  
  and Rome as well as the Bible and
  
   ancient Jewish history
  
  . Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual with its
  
   TRIGA research reactor
  
  making it the only school in the United States to have a
  
   nuclear reactor
  
  operated entirely by undergraduates.
  

    [15]
   

  Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation with successful completion of a junior qualifying exam at the end of the junior year a prerequisite to beginning the thesis. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral exam that may encompass questions not only about the thesis but also about any course previously taken.
 
  Reed maintains a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio,
  

    [16]
   

  and its small classes emphasize a "conference" style where the teacher often acts as a mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer. While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.

  Although letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed and focus is placed on a
  
   narrative evaluation
  
  . According to the school, "A conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student, but the registrar's office does not distribute grades to students, provided that work continues at satisfactory (C or higher) levels. Unsatisfactory grades are reported directly to the student and the student's adviser. Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed."
  

    [17]
   

  There is no
  
   dean's list
  
  or honor roll
  
   per se
  
  , but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an academic year receive academic commendations at the end of the spring semester which are noted on their transcripts.
  

    [17]
   

  Many Reed students graduate without knowing their cumulative
  
   GPA
  
  or their grades in individual classes.

  Reed also claims to have experienced very little
  
   grade inflation
  
  over the years, noting, for example, that only ten students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2012.
  

    [18]
   

  (Transcripts are accompanied by a card explaining Reed's relatively tough grading system so as not to penalize students applying to graduate schools.)
  

    [19]
   

  Although Reed does not award
  
   Latin honors
  
  to graduates, it confers several awards for academic achievement at commencement, including naming students to
  
   Phi Beta Kappa
  
  .
  

    [20]
   


  Reed has no
  
   fraternities or sororities
  
  and few
  
   NCAA
  
  sports teams
  

    [21]
   

  although physical education classes (which range from
  
   kayaking
  
  to
  
   juggling
  
  ) are required for graduation. Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic clubs, most notably the Rugby,
  

    [22]
   

  Ultimate Frisbee,
  

    [23]
   



    [24]
   

  and Soccer
  

    [25]
   

  teams.
 
     What this means is that a community governed by an honor principle is a community not of rules and procedures but of virtue. As such, it is a community of unfreedom. There is no protected realm; one can never take refuge in, seek protection from, or hide behind a doctrine of rights. Anything that anyone does is, in principle, subject to evaluation. Was it a virtuous thing to do? Was it consistent with notions of honorableness? Does it contribute to the well-being of the community? Is it the kind of behavior that we value and wish to encourage? In the absence of rights, behavior that we do not wish to value and do not wish to encourage has absolutely no protection.
    
  Reed's ethical code is known as "The Honor Principle".
  

    [27]
   

  First introduced as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life. While inspired by traditional
  
   honor systems
  
  , Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves and not just their enforcement. Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior. Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.
 
  Discrete cases of grievance, known as "Honor Cases," are adjudicated by a Judicial Board of twelve full-time students. There is also an "Honor Council" of students, faculty, and staff who educate the community on the Honor Principle and mediate conflict between individuals.
  

    [28]
   


  Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program. Overall, Reed offers five
  
   Humanities
  
  courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students.
 
  Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole "an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and, ... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind".
  

    [29]
   

  The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in "world" literature, the other in "world" history) is one manifestation of this effort. One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995. The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus. These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.
  

    [30]
   


  Reed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course
  
   Introduction to Western Humanities
  
  covering ancient
  
   Greek
  
  and
  
   Roman
  
  literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take
  
   Early Modern Europe
  
  covering
  
   Renaissance
  
  thought and literature;
  
   Modern Humanities
  
  covering the
  
   Enlightenment
  
  , the
  
   French Revolution
  
  , the
  
   Industrial Revolution
  
  , and
  
   Modernism
  
  , and/or
  
   Foundations of Chinese Civilization
  
  . There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.

  For Fall 2016, the Freshman class had 357 students. 10% were valedictorians of their high school classes and another 2% were salutatorians. 32% ranked in the top 5% of their class. The median scores on their SAT tests were 680 math, 710 verbal, and 680 writing, which puts them at the 96th percentile. The class was drawn from the largest pool ever—5,705 applicants—and was the most selective in Reed’s history, with an admittance rate of 31%.
  

    [43]
   


  The total base cost for the 2012–13 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, is $55,920.
  

    [44]
   

  "For the 2011–12 academic year, the average financial aid package – including grants, loans, and work opportunities – is approximately $35,990".
  

    [45]
   

  In 2011–12 about half of students received financial aid from the college.
  

    [46]
   

  In 2004 (the most recent data available), 1.4% of Reed graduates defaulted on their student loans
  

    [47]
   

  – below the national
  
   Cohort Default Rate
  
  average of 5.1%.

  Reed's endowment as of June 30, 2014, was $543 million.
  

    [49]
   

  In the economic downturn that began in late 2007, Reed's total endowment had declined from $455 million in June 2007 to $311 million in June 2009.
  

    [50]
   

  By the end of 2013, however, the endowment surpassed the $500 million mark.

  In 1995, Reed College refused to participate in the
  

    U.S. News & World Report
   

  "best colleges" rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings. According to Reed's Office of Admissions the school's refusal to participate is based in 1994 disclosures by the
  

    Wall Street Journal
   

  about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in
  
   U.S. News
  
  and other popular college guides.
  

    [55]
   



    [56]
   


   U.S. News
  
  maintains that their rankings are "a very legitimate tool for getting at a certain level of knowledge about colleges."
  

    [57]
   


  In 2015,
  

    Money
   

  magazine ranked Reed College 196th among U.S. colleges with an overall score of C+ based on its aggregate score on measures of educational quality, tuition costs, and post-graduation alumni earnings.
  

    [58]
   


  Reed is ranked as tied for the 93rd best liberal arts college by
  

    U.S. News & World Report
   

  in its 2016 rankings, and tied for 18th in its high school counselor rankings, although the former has been harshly criticized by the college.
  

    [55]
   


  In 2006,
  

    Newsweek
   

  magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five "New Ivies",
  

    [59]
   

  listing it among "the nation's elite colleges." In 2012,
  
   Newsweek
  
  ranked Reed the 15th "most rigorous" college in the nation.

  Reed has produced the second-highest number of
  
   Rhodes scholars
  
  for any liberal arts college—32—as well as over fifty
  
   Fulbright Scholars
  
  , over sixty
  
   Watson Fellows

  A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn PhDs, particularly in the sciences, history,
  
   political science
  
  , and philosophy. Reed is third in percentage of its graduates who go on to earn PhDs in all disciplines, after only
  
   Caltech
  
  and
  
   Harvey Mudd
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  In 1961,

   Loren Pope
  
  , former education editor for
  

    The New York Times
   
   ,
  
  writes about Reed in
  

    Colleges That Change Lives
   
   ,
  
  saying, "If you're a genuine intellectual, live the life of the mind, and want to learn for the sake of learning, the place most likely to empower you is not Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, or Stanford. It is the most intellectual college in the country—Reed in Portland, Oregon."

  Since the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students.
  

    [66]
   



    The Insider's Guide to the Colleges
   

  , written by the staff of
  

    Yale Daily News
   

  , notes an impression among students of institutional permissiveness: "According to students, the school does not bust students for drug or alcohol use unless they cause harm or embarrassment to another student."
  

    [67]
   


  In April 2008, student Alex Lluch died of a heroin overdose in his on-campus dorm room.
  

    [68]
   

  His death prompted revelations of several previous incidents, including the near-death heroin overdose of another student only months earlier.
  

    [69]
   

  College President Colin Diver said "I don't honestly know" whether the drug death was an isolated incident or part of a larger problem. "When you say Reed," Diver said, "two words often come to mind. One is brains. One is drugs."
  

    [70]
   

  Local reporter James Pitkin of the newspaper
  

    Willamette Week
   

  editorialized that "Reed College, a private school with one of the most prestigious academic programs in the U.S., is one of the last schools in the country where students enjoy almost unlimited freedom to experiment openly with drugs, with little or no hassles from authorities," though
  
   Willamette Week
  
  stated the following week concerning Pitkin's editorial: "As of press time, almost 500 responses, many expressing harsh criticism of
  
   Willamette Week
  
  , had been posted on our website."
  

    [71]
   


  In March 2010, another student died of drug-related causes in his off-campus residence.
  

    [72]
   

  This led
  

    The New York Times
   

  to conclude that "Reed…has long been known almost as much for its unusually permissive atmosphere as for its impressively rigorous academics." Law enforcement authorities promised to take action, including sending undercover agents to Reed's annual
  
   Renn Fayre
  
  celebration.
  

    [73]
   



    [74]
   


  Reed has a reputation for being politically liberal.
  

    [13]
   


  During the
  
   McCarthy era
  
  of the 1950s, then-President Duncan Ballantine fired Marxist philosopher Stanley Moore, a tenured professor, for his failure to cooperate with the
  
   House Un-American Activities Committee
  
  (HUAC) investigation.
  

    [75]
   



    [76]
   

  According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, "because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities. Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and nontenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest. At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure."
  

    [77]
   

  A statement of "regret" by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees. In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the College, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.
  

    [78]
   


  The Reed College campus was established on a southeast
  
   Portland
  
  tract of land known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims. The college's grounds include 116 acres (0.47 km
  
   2
  
  ) of contiguous land, including a wooded wetland known as Reed Canyon.
 
  Portland architect
  
   A. E. Doyle
  
  developed a plan, never implemented in full, modeled on the University of Oxford's
  
   St. John's College
  
  . The original campus buildings (including the Library, the
  
   Old Dorm Block
  
  , and what is now the primary administration building,
  
   Eliot Hall
  
  ) are brick
  
   Tudor Gothic
  
  buildings in a style similar to
  
   Ivy League
  
  campuses. In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the
  
   Modernist
  
  style. The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by Modernist architect
  
   Pietro Belluschi
  
  at the same time as his celebrated
  
   Equitable Building
  
  in downtown Portland.
 
  The campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth, and there are now 21 academic and administrative buildings and 18 residence halls. Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy. At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use. Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a 1.5-acre (0.61
  
   ha
  
  ) tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive. Reed’s "immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007–08 academic year. Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing".
  

    [79]
   


  Reed houses about 1,000 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus.
  

    [80]
   

  Residence halls on campus range from the traditional (i.e., Gothic Old Dorm Block, referred to as "ODB") to the eclectic (e.g., Anna Mann, a Tudor-style cottage built in the 1920s by Reed's founding architect A. E. Doyle, originally used as a women's hall
  

    [81]
   

  ), language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), "temporary" housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon – Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan). There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to Japanese culture to music to a dorm for students interested in outdoors activities (hiking, climbing, bicycling, kayaking, skiing, etc.).
  

    [82]
   

  The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the College's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as "Asylum Block" because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an
  
   insane asylum
  
  .
  

    [83]
   

  Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect
  
   Pietro Belluschi
  
  .
 
  Under the 10-year Campus Master Plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced, and MacNaughton to be remodeled.
  

    [80]
   

  According to the master plan, "The College's goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the [full-time] student population. At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students".
  

    [80]
   


  In Spring 2007, the College broke ground on the construction of a new quadrangle called the Grove with four new residence halls (Aspen, Sequoia, Sitka, Bidwell) on the northwest side of the campus, which opened in Fall 2008. A new Spanish House residence was completed. Together, the five new residences added 142 new beds.
  

    [81]
   


  Reed also has off-campus housing. Many houses in the
  
   Woodstock
  
  and
  
   Eastmoreland
  
  Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.
 
  The Reed College Canyon, a natural area and national wildlife preserve, bisects the campus, separating the academic buildings from many of the residence halls (the so-called
  
   cross-canyon halls
  
  ). The canyon is filled by Crystal Creek Springs, a
  
   natural spring
  
  that drains into
  
   Johnson Creek
  
  .
  

    [84]
   


  Canyon Day, a tradition dating back to 1915, is held twice a year. On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.
  

    [85]
   


  A landmark of the campus, the
  
   Blue Bridge
  
  , spans the canyon. This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which "featured stressed plywood girders – the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge 132 feet (40 m) long and 15 feet (4.6 m) high. It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime".
  

    [86]
   


  A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008. This bridge, dubbed the "Bouncy Bridge" or "Amber Bridge" by students, is 370 feet (110 m) long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and "connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus".

  Reed's Cooley Gallery is an internationally recognized contemporary art space located at the entrance to the
  
   Eric V. Hauser Memorial Library
  
  . It was established in 1988 as the result of a gift from Susan and Edward Cooley in honor of their late son.
  

    [87]
   

  The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as
  
   Mona Hatoum
  
  ,
  
   Al Held
  
  ,
  
   David Reed
  
  and
  
   Gregory Crewdson
  
  as well as the contemporary art collection of
  
   Michael Ovitz
  
  .
  

    [88]
   

  In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits. The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder,
  

    [89]
   

  who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.
 
  The cafeteria, known simply as "Commons," has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services. The commons dining hall is operated by
  
   Bon Appétit
  
  , and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis. Suiting the student body,
  
   vegan
  
  and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu. It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception of Caffe Circo (formerly Caffe Paradiso), a small cafe on the other side of campus which also operated by board points.
 
  The Reed College Co-ops are a theme community that reside in the Farm and Garden Houses, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall. These are the only campus dorms that are independent of the school's board plan. They traditionally throw an alternative "Thanksgiving" celebration that has sometimes included a square-dance. The Co-ops house students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings. It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants.

  The Paradox ("Est. in the 80s") is a student-run coffee shop located on campus. In 2003 the Paradox opened a second coffee shop, dubbing it the "Paradox Lost" (an allusion to
  
   John Milton
  
  's
  

    Paradise Lost
   
   ,
  
  ) at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the "Bio Fishbowl." The new north-campus dorms, which opened in Fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, originally dubbed "Cafe Paradiso," thereby providing three coffee shops within a 116-acre (0.47 km
  
   2
  
  ) campus. The recent addition of a circus-themed mural to the cafe prompted a name change, and it now operates as Caffe Circo. This third shop is not student-run, but is operated by
  
   Bon Appétit
  
  .
  
   Bon Appétit
  
  has a monopoly on the food services at Reed as they are the only ones who accept board points; written into their contract is the prohibition of food carts on campus.
 
  The official mascot of Reed is the
  
   griffin
  
  . In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of
  
   Dante
  
  's
  

    Commedia
   

  the griffin is associated with the
  
   Tree of Knowledge
  
  . The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed
  

    [4]
   

  and is now on the official seal of Reed College.
 
  The official school color of Reed is Richmond Rose.
  

    [91]
   

  Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon. The most common examples of "Richmond Rose" are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.
 
  The school song, "Fair Reed," is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song "
  
   Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms
  
  ." It may be imitative of the Harvard anthem "Fair Harvard," which is also sung to the tune of "Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms." It was composed by former president
  
   William Trufant Foster
  
  shortly after Reed's founding, and is rarely heard today.
  

    [92]
   


  An unofficial Reed Alma Mater, "
  
   Epistemology
  
  Forever," sung to the tune of "
  
   The Battle Hymn of the Republic
  
  ," has been sung by Reed students since the 1950s.
  

    [93]
   


  Reed students and alumni referred to themselves as "Reedites" in the early years of the college. This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous "Reedie" after World War II.
  

    [94]
   

  Around campus, prospective students are called "prospies."
 
  An unofficial motto of Reed is "Communism, Atheism, Free Love," and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, T-shirts, etc. It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a "tongue-in-cheek slogan" in reference to Reed's
  
   nonconformism
  
  . Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into World War I, as well as the college's support for feminism, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the
  
   Socialist Party of America
  
  to speak on campus about the
  
   Russian Revolution
  
  ’s potential impact on
  
   militarism
  
  , emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its
  
   nonsectarian
  
  status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.
  

    [95]
   



    [96]
   


  The faux Reed Seal has changed over the years. In its original form the griffin was holding a hammer and sickle in its paws. Later versions had the griffin wearing boxing gloves.
 
  One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the
  
   Doyle Owl
  
  , a roughly 280-pound (130 kg) concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since about 1919. The original Doyle Owl (originally "House F Owl" after the dormitory named House F that later became Doyle dormitory) was a garden sculpture from the neighborhood stolen by House F residents as a prank (there is a photo of House F residents around the original owl that has been made into a T-shirt). The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl's
  
   oral history
  
  . The original Doyle Owl was destroyed many years ago; the current avatar is Doyle Owl number 13, plus or minus 11.
  

    [97]
   

  At the present time only one Owl is being shown.

  Each January, before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds an interim period called
  
   Paideia
  
  (roughly drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education').
  

    [100]
   

  Originally conceived and approved by the faculty in 1968 for unstructured independent study or "UIS," Paideia ran for the full month of January from 1969–1981, supervised by a committee of faculty, staff and students.
  

    [101]
   

  This festival of learning takes the form of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community. The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed.
  

    [100]
   

  Many such classes are explicitly trivial (one long-running tradition is to hold an
  
   underwater basket weaving
  
  class), while others are trivially academic (such as "Giant Concrete Gnome Construction," a class that, incidental to building monolithic
  
   gnomes
  
  , includes some content relating to the construction of pre-Christian
  
   monoliths
  
  ). More structured classes (such as martial arts seminars and mini-classes on obscure academic topics), tournaments, and film festivals round out the schedule, which is different every year. The objective of Paideia is not only to learn new (possibly non-useful) things, but to turn the tables on students and encourage them to teach.
 
  In his 2005 Stanford commencement lecture,
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  founder and Reed
  
   dropout
  

   Steve Jobs
  
  credited a Reed
  
   calligraphy
  
  class taught by
  
   Robert Palladino
  
  for his focus on choosing quality typefaces for the
  
   Macintosh
  
  .
  

    [102]
   

  While the full calligraphy course
  

    [103]
   

  is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject in addition to the informal, weekly gatherings (currently held every Thursday night) of aspiring calligraphy enthusiasts.
 
  Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration with a different theme each year. Born in the 1960s as an actual
  
   renaissance fair
  
  , it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the
  
   Renaissance
  
  , although its name has persisted. The event is initiated by a procession of seniors throwing their thesis notes in a large bonfire after the completed theses are submitted.
 
  Reed Arts Week is a week-long celebration of the arts at Reed. It features music, dance, film, creative writing, and the visual arts.
 
  According to Reed's website, each semester, a $130 student body fee "is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate. The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin."
  

    [104]
   

  Student body funds (totaling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester's funding poll. The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either 'top six,' 'approve,' 'no opinion,' 'disapprove,' or 'deep six.' These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters.
  

    [105]
   

  Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus. The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.
 
  The school's student-run newspaper,
  
   The Reed College Quest
  
  or simply the
  
   Quest,
  
  has been published since 1913, and its radio station,
  
   KRRC
  
  has been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, since 1955.
  

    [106]
   



    [107]
   


  Although some that partner with outside groups such as
  
   Oxfam
  
  or
  
   Planned Parenthood
  
  are more structured, most organizations are highly informal. There is no formal process for forming a student organization at Reed; a group of students (or a single student) announcing themselves as or just considering themselves a student organization is enough. Groups that want funding from the school's Student Activities office or Student Body Fees, however, must register with Student Activities or through the Student Senate. Other clubs at Reed are more controversial, such as the Master and Bation Club, a group dedicated to weekly gatherings focused on
  
   masturbation
  
  and sextoy sharing. The Reed archive of comic books and
  
   graphic novels
  
  , the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various
  
   beer gardens
  
  throughout the year and during
  
   Renn Fayre
  
  , has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective – dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture – have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.
  

    [108]
   


  Reed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on
  
   Mount Hood
  
  , recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.
  

    [109]
   


  According to a
  

    Washington Post
   

  analysis of federal campus safety data from 2014, Reed College had 12.9 reports of rape per 1,000 students, the "highest total of reports of rape" per 1,000 students of any college in the nation on its main campus.
  

    [110]
   


  In 2012, Reed College had the third highest reported sexual assault rate among U.S. colleges and universities. It is unclear whether this high reporting rate arises from an environment that is more supportive of reporting by crime victims or due to a higher underlying rate of sexual assault.
  

    [111]
   

  in 2013 there were 19 reported forcible sexual offenses among the approximately 1,400 students at the college.
  

    [112]
   

  In 2011 a student member of Reed's Judicial Board resigned over the college's handling of sexual assault cases. An investigation by the
  
   Center for Public Integrity
  
  found that those found responsible in cases of sexual assault frequently faced few consequences, while the lives of the victims were left in turmoil.
