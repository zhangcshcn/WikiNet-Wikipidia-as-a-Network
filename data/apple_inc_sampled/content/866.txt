  A
  
   googol
  
  is the
  
   large number
  
  10
  
   100
  
  . In decimal notation, it is written as the
  
   digit
  
  1 followed by one hundred
  
   0s
  
  : 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
 


  The term was coined in 1920 by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta (1911–1981), nephew of U.S.
  
   mathematician
  

   Edward Kasner
  
  .
  

    [1]
   

  Kasner popularized the concept in his 1940 book
  

    Mathematics and the Imagination
   

  .
  

    [2]
   

  Other
  
   names
  
  for googol include
  
   ten duotrigintillion
  
  on the
  
   short scale
  
  ,
  
   ten thousand sexdecillion
  
  on the
  
   long scale
  
  , or
  
   ten sexdecilliard
  
  on the
  
   Peletier long scale
  
  .
 
  A googol has no special significance in mathematics. However, it is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of
  
   subatomic particles
  
  in the visible universe or the number of hypothetical possibilities in a
  
   chess
  
  game. Kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and
  
   infinity
  
  , and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics. To give a sense of how big a googol really is, the mass of an electron, just under

   10
   
    −30
   
   kg
  
  , can be compared to the mass of the visible universe, estimated at between

    50
   

  and

   10

  .

  It is a ratio in the order of about 10
  
   80
  
  to 10
  
   90
  
  , or only about one ten-billionth of a googol (0.00000001% of a googol).
 

   Carl Sagan
  
  points out that the total number of elementary particles in the universe is around 10
  
   80
  
  (the
  
   Eddington number
  
  ) and that if the whole universe were packed with neutrons so that there would be no empty space anywhere, there would be around 10
  
   128
  
  . He also notes the similarity of the first calculation to that of
  
   Archimedes
  
  in
  
   The Sand Reckoner
  
  .

  The decay time for a supermassive
  
   black hole
  
  of roughly 1 galaxy-mass (10
  
   11
  

   solar masses
  
  ) due to
  
   Hawking radiation
  
  is on the order of 10
  
   100
  
  years.
  

    [5]
   

  Therefore, the
  
   heat death of the universe
  
  is lower-bounded to occur a googol years in the future.
 
  A googol is approximately
  
   70!
  
  (
  
   factorial
  
  of 70). Using an
  
   integral
  
  ,
  
   binary numeral system
  
  , one would need 333 bits to represent a googol, i.e., 1 googol ≈ 2
  
   332.19280949
  
  , or exactly

   floating point
  
  type.

  Widespread sounding of the word occurs through the name of the company
  
   Google
  
  , with the name "Google" being an accidental misspelling of "googol" by the company's founders,
  

    [6]
   

  which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.
  

    [7]
   

  In 2004, family members of Kasner, who had inherited the right to his book, were considering suing Google for their use of the term googol;
  

    [8]
   

  however, no suit was ever filed.
 
  Since October 2009 Google has been assigning domain names to its servers under the domain "1e100.net", the scientific notation for 1 googol, in order to provide a single domain to identify servers across the Google network.

    Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

   cheated his way through the show
  
  with the help of an accomplice.
