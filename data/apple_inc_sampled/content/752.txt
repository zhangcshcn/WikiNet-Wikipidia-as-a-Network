   Boot Camp Assistant
  
  is a
  
   multi boot
  

   utility
  
  included with
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  's
  
   Mac OS X
  
  that assists users in installing
  
   Microsoft Windows
  

   operating systems
  
  on
  
   Intel-based Macintosh
  
  computers. The utility guides users through non-destructive
  
   disk partitioning
  
  (including resizing of an existing
  
   HFS+
  
  partition, if necessary) of their
  
   hard disk drive
  
  and installation of Windows
  
   device drivers
  
  for the Apple hardware. The utility also installs a
  
   Windows Control Panel
  

   applet
  
  for selecting the boot operating system.
 
  Initially introduced as an unsupported beta for
  
   Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger
  
  ,

  the utility was first included with
  
   Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard
  
  and has been included in subsequent versions of the operating system ever since. Previous versions of Boot Camp supported
  
   Windows XP
  
  ,
  
   Windows Vista
  
  and
  
   Windows 7
  
  . Boot Camp 4.0 for
  
   Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard
  
  up to
  
   Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion
  
  version 10.8.2 only supported Windows 7.
  

    [3]
   

  However, with the release of Boot Camp 5.0 for
  
   Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion
  
  inversion 10.8.3, only
  
   64-bit
  
  versions of Windows 7 and
  
   Windows 8
  
  are officially supported.

  Boot Camp 6.0 added support for
  
   Windows 10
  
  . Boot Camp 6.1 (
  
   macOS 10.12 Sierra
  
  only) will only accept new installations of
  
   Windows 10
  
  .
 


  Setting up
  
   Windows 10
  
  on a Mac requires a USB flash drive and the
  
   ISO image
  
  of Windows 10 provided by Microsoft. Boot Camp reformats the flash drive as a Mac bootable install disk, and combines Windows 10 with install scripts to load hardware drivers for the targeted Mac computer.
 
  Boot Camp currently supports Windows 10 on a range of Macs dated mid-2012 or newer.

  By default, Mac will always boot from the last-used startup disk. Holding down the
  
   option key
  
  (⌥) at startup brings up the
  
   boot manager
  
  , allowing the user to choose which operating system to start up. When using a non-Apple keyboard, the
  
   alt key
  
  usually performs the same action. The boot manager can also be launched by holding down the “menu” button on the
  
   Apple Remote
  
  at startup.
 
  On older Macs, its functionality relies on
  
   BIOS
  
  emulation through
  
   EFI
  
  and a partition table information synchronization mechanism between
  
   GPT
  
  and
  
   MBR
  
  combined.

  On newer Macs, Boot Camp keeps the hard disk as a
  
   GPT
  
  so that Windows is installed and booted in
  
   UEFI
  
  mode.

  By running the Boot Camp assistant with a compatible version of Microsoft Windows setup disc in the drive and switching to a Windows 8 disc when. Mac OS X reboots the machine to begin installing Windows, Windows 8 can be installed on older unsupported hardware.
