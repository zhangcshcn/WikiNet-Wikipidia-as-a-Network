  An
  
   arboretum
  
  (plural:
  
   arboreta
  
  ) in a narrow sense is a collection of trees only. Related collections include a fruticetum (from the
  
   Latin
  

   frutex
  
  , meaning
  
   shrub
  
  ), and a viticetum, a collection of
  
   vines
  
  . More commonly, today, an arboretum is a
  
   botanical garden
  
  containing living collections of woody plants intended at least partly for scientific study. An arboretum specializing in growing
  
   conifers
  
  is known as a
  
   pinetum
  
  . Other specialist arboreta include
  
   saliceta
  
  (willows),
  
   populeta
  
  , and
  
   querceta
  
  (oaks).
 
  The term
  
   arboretum
  
  was first used in an
  
   English
  
  publication by
  
   John Claudius Loudon
  
  in 1833 in
  
   The Gardener's Magazine
  
  but the concept was already long-established by then.

  Arboreta are special places for the cultivation and display of a wide variety of different kinds of trees and shrubs (that is ligneous plants). Many tree collections have been claimed as the first arboretum, in most cases, however, the term has been applied retrospectively as it did not come into use until the later eighteenth century. Arboreta differ from pieces of woodland or plantations because they are botanically significant collections with a variety of examples rather than just a few kinds. Of course there are many tree collections that are much older than the eighteenth century in different parts of the world. Probably the most important early proponent of the arboretum in the English-speaking transatlantic world was the prolific landscape gardener and writer, John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843) who undertook many gardening commissions and published the
  
   Gardener's Magazine
  
  ,
  
   Encyclopaedia of Gardening
  
  and other major works. Loudon's
  
   Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum
  
  , 8 vols., (1838) is probably the most significant work on the subject in British history and included an account of all trees and shrubs that were hardy in the British climate, an international history of arboriculture, an assessment of the cultural, economic and industrial value of trees and four volumes of plates. Loudon urged that a national arboretum be created and called for arboreta and other systematic collections to be established in public parks, private gardens, country estates and other places. He regarded the Derby Arboretum (1840) as the most important landscape-gardening commission of the latter part of his career because it demonstrated the benefits of a public arboretum (for more details see below). Commenting on
  
   Loddiges
  
  ' famous
  
   Hackney Botanic Garden
  
  arboretum, begun in 1816, which was a commercial nursery that subsequently opened free to the public, for educational benefit, every Sunday, Loudon wrote: "The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... The more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. We walked round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from
  
   Acer
  
  to
  
   Quercus
  
  . There is no garden scene about London so interesting". A plan of Loddiges' arboretum was included in
  
   The Encyclopaedia of Gardening
  
  , 1834 edition. Leaves from Loddiges' arboretum and in some instances entire trees, were studiously drawn to illustrate Loudon's encyclopaedic book
  
   Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum
  
  which also incorporated drawings from other early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the United Kingdom.

  One example of an early European tree collection is the
  
   Trsteno Arboretum
  
  , near
  
   Dubrovnik
  
  in
  
   Croatia
  
  . The date of its founding is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m (50 ft) span
  
   aqueduct
  
  to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. The garden was created by the prominent local Gučetić/Gozze family. It suffered two major disasters in the 1990s but its two unique and ancient
  
   Oriental Planes
  
  remained standing.
 
  The
  
   arboretum at Ooty
  
  was established in 1992 with an aim of conserving native and indigenous trees; it occupies 1.58 hectares (3.9 acres) near Ooty lake. It was established during the year 1992 and maintained by Department of Horticulture with Hill Area Development Programme funds. The micro watershed area leading to Ooty lake where the arboretum is now located, had been neglected and the feeder line feeding water to Ooty was contaminated with urban waste and agricultural chemicals. The area is the natural habitats of both indigenous and migratory birds. During the year 2005-2006, it was rehabilated with funds provided by the Hill Area Development Programme (Rs 1,250,000) by providing permanent fencing, a foot path, and other infrastructure facilities.
 
  Both indigenous and exotic tree species are included; about 80 trees were previously present,

  Shortly before the
  
   Derby Arboretum
  
  opened in 1840, another arboretum was opened for free public access at
  
   Abney Park Cemetery
  
  in
  
   Stoke Newington
  
  near London, modelled partly on
  
   Mount Auburn Cemetery
  
  near Boston and designed by
  
   Loddiges
  
  nursery. It was laid out with 2,500 trees and shrubs, all labelled and arranged in an unusual alphabetical format from A for
  
   Acer
  
  (maple trees) to Z for
  
   Zanthoxylum
  
  (American toothache trees). Until
  
   Kew
  
  was enlarged and opened to the public, this remained the largest arboretum in Europe. It never achieved the recognition of the better financed early nineteenth century botanical gardens and arboreta that could afford members' events, indoor facilities and curatoral staff for those who paid accordingly. However unlike these, and even unlike the 'public' arboretum at Derby, the Abney Park arboretum always offered public access free of charge, though sometimes, by pre-arrangement; a
  
   Viewing Order
  
  was needed so as not to interfere with funeral events.

  The Derby Arboretum opened on 16 September 1840. Commissioned and presented by Joseph Strutt (1766–1844) a wealthy industrialist and major local benefactor, the Derby Arboretum was designed by John Claudius Loudon and had a major impact upon the development of urban parks. It was one of the first Victorian public parks and also unusual for the quality of its collection of trees and shrubs. Although established on only quite a small site of 14 acres, the park featured a labelled collection of over 1000 trees and shrubs and was landscaped with mounds, sinuous paths, urns, benches, statues, lodges and other features. Managed by a committee until it was acquired by the Derby Corporation during the 1880s, the Derby Arboretum was only open free to the public for two days of the week for its first four decades, the remaining days being reserved for subscribers and their families and guests. Very popular anniversary festivals were staged annually which drew crowds of tens of thousands and helped to fund the upkeep of the park. The Derby Arboretum is also significant because it was the planted counterpart to Loudon's
  
   Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum
  
  (1838) which detailed all the hardy and semi-hardy trees and shrubs of the British Isles. Within the park, the trees and shrubs were laid out according to the natural system and labelled so that visitors could identify them using the guide.
  

    [8]
   

  The Derby park had a major impact on park design elsewhere including Europe, the British colonies and North America and other public parks and arboreta were established modelled on Loudon's creation and using his ideas. In 1859 for example, it was visited by
  
   Frederick Law Olmsted
  
  on his European tour of parks, and it had an influence on the planting in
  
   Central Park
  
  , New York. Industrial pollution killed most of the original plantings by the 1880s (although a few examples remain), but it has been renovated and replanted with National Lottery Heritage funding closer to Loudon's original layout and with a new cafe and visitor centre, is well worth a visit.

   Lord Grenville
  
  . On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time Grenville died in 1834, his
  
   pinetum
  
  contained the biggest collection of
  
   conifer
  
  species in Britain. Part of the post-millennium restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.

   Grimstad
  
  municipality,
  
   Aust-Agder
  
  county,
  
   Norway
  
  . In the Dømmesmoen forest, where the arboret is planned in harmony with nature, 22 different ecosystems have been defined. The trees and plants have been planted along the tracks so that the visitors can experience and learn about them in the various ecosystems. Information about the various ecosystems are found along the tracks in the forest and park area.
  

    [10]
   

  Through the years, approximately 700 different species of trees and plants have been planted in the Dømmesmoen area.

  The Nottingham Arboretum (1852) was designed by Samuel Curtis as the centrepiece of a major scheme enclosing the common lands around the town. It included various public walks, parks, cemeteries and other green spaces. The Nottingham Arboretum was modelled on Loudon's Derby Arboretum and also originally had a systematic labelled collection of trees and shrubs. Advantage was taken on the hilly site to produce an attractive landscaped park with a small lake, lodges, benches and other features and some of the nineteenth-century trees still survive.

  at the Holford estate. Holford planted in open fields and laid out rides before he rebuilt the house. Planting at Westonbirt was continued by his son, George Holford. Eventually the estate passed to the government in lieu of death duties and was opened to the public. Also the word "arbortorium" was changed to arboretum in the early 1950s. The arboretum comprises some 18,000 trees and shrubs, over an area of approximately 600 acres (240 ha). It has 17 miles (27 km) of marked paths which also provide access to a wide variety of rare plants.
