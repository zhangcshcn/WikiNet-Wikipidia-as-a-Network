   AirPlay
  
  is a
  
   proprietary protocol
  

   stack/suite
  
  developed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  that allows wireless
  
   streaming
  
  between devices of audio, video, device screens, and photos, together with related
  
   metadata
  
  . Originally implemented only in Apple's software and devices, it was called
  
   AirTunes
  
  and used for audio only.
  

    [2]
   

  Apple has since licensed the AirPlay protocol stack as a
  
   third-party software component
  
  technology to manufacturer partners for them to use in their products in order to be compatible with Apple's devices.
 


  There are two types of AirPlay devices, those that send audiovisual content, and those capable of receiving the content and rendering it on displays and speakers.
 
  AirPlay sender devices include computers running
  
   iTunes
  
  , and
  
   iOS devices
  
  such as
  
   iPhones
  
  ,
  
   iPods
  
  , and
  
   iPads
  
  running
  
   iOS
  
  4.2 or greater.
  
   OS X Mountain Lion
  
  supports display mirroring via AirPlay on systems containing 2nd generation Intel Core processors or later.
  

    [3]
   

  There are third party streamers such as
  
   AirFoil
  
  .
 
  In 2016 HTC released an Android phone with Apple AirPlay streaming.
  

    [4]
   


  As of iOS 4.3, third-party apps may send compatible audio and video streams over AirPlay.
  

    [5]
   

  The
  
   iTunes Remote
  
  app on iOS can be used to control media playback and select AirPlay streaming receivers for iTunes running on a Mac or PC.
  

    [6]
   


  AirPlay receiver devices include
  
   AirPort Express
  
  (which includes a combined analog and optical
  
   S/PDIF
  
  audio output connector),
  
   Apple TV
  
  , and third party speakers. With the open source implementations of the AirPlay protocol any computer can now be turned into an AirPlay receiver.
  

    [7]
   


  However, because not all third-party receivers implement Apple's DRM encryption, some media, such as iTunes Store's own rights-protected music (Apple's own "
  
   FairPlay
  
  " encryption),
  
   YouTube
  
  and
  
   Netflix
  
  , cannot stream to those devices or software. On Apple TV starting with firmware 6.0, the "FairPlay" encryption scheme is enforced and sending devices not supporting it cannot be used.
  

    [8]
   


  AirPlay wireless technology is integrated into speaker docks, AV receivers, and stereo systems from companies such as
  
   Bose
  
  ,
  
   Yamaha
  
  ,
  
   Philips
  
  ,
  
   Marantz
  
  ,
  
   Bowers & Wilkins
  
  ,
  
   Pioneer
  
  ,
  
   Sony
  
  , McIntosh, and
  
   Denon
  
  .

  Song titles, artists, album names, elapsed and remaining time, and album artwork can appear on AirPlay-enabled speakers with graphical displays. Often these receivers are built to only support the audio component of AirPlay, much like AirTunes.
 
  Bluetooth devices (headsets, speakers) that support the
  
   A2DP
  
  profile also appear as AirPlay receivers when paired with an iOS device, although Bluetooth is a device-to-device protocol that does not rely on a wireless network access point.
 
  There are third party receivers such as
  
   AirServer
  
  , Reflector 2,
  
   Kodi
  


    [10]
   

  and TuneAero (audio).
 
  The AirTunes part of the AirPlay protocol stack uses
  
   UDP
  
  for streaming audio and is based on the
  
   RTSP
  
  network control protocol.
  

    [11]
   

  The streams are transcoded using the
  
   Apple Lossless
  
  codec with 44100Â Hz and 2 channels encrypted with
  
   AES
  
  , requiring the receiver to have access to the appropriate private key to decrypt the streams.
  

    [12]
   

  The stream is buffered for approximately 2 seconds before playback begins, resulting in a small delay before audio is output after starting an AirPlay stream.
  

    [13]
   


  The protocol supports metadata packets that determine the final output volume on the receiving end. This makes it possible to always send audio data unprocessed at its original full volume, preventing sound quality deterioration due to reduction in
  
   bit depth
  
  and thus sound quality which would otherwise occur if changes in volume were made to the source stream before transmitting. It also makes possible the streaming of one source to multiple targets each with its own volume control.
  

    [14]
   


  The AirPort Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's
  
   Remote Audio Output Protocol
  
  (RAOP), a proprietary variant of
  
   RTSP
  
  /
  
   RTP
  
  . Using
  
   WDS
  
  -bridging,
  

    [15]
   

  the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality (as well as Internet access,
  
   file
  
  and
  
   print sharing
  
  , etc.) across a larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless clients.
  


  At
  
   WWDC 2011
  
  , Jobs announced AirPlay Mirroring as a feature in
  
   iOS
  
  5 where the user can stream the screen from an iPad 2 to a HDTV wirelessly and securely without the need for cables.

  AirPlay Mirroring is a slightly different technology that allows specific content to be broadcast from a variety of iOS devices and iTunes to a second generation Apple TV. The exact composition of the protocols that AirPlay Mirroring uses have not yet fully been discovered, or reverse-engineered.
  

    [17]
   

  However, an unofficial AirPlay protocol specification is available.
  

    [18]
   

  A 2nd generation or later Apple TV is required, and supported hardware (when using OS X Mountain Lion or later) includes the iMac (mid 2011 or newer), Mac mini (mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Air (mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Pro (early 2011 or newer) and the Mac Pro (late 2013 or newer).
  

    [19]
   


  When the protocol was known as AirTunes, it was
  
   reverse-engineered
  
  by
  
   Jon Lech Johansen
  
  in 2004.
  

    [12]
   


  On April 8, 2011, James Laird reverse-engineered and released the private key used by the Apple
  
   AirPort Express
  
  to decrypt incoming audio streams.
  

    [20]
   

  The release of this key means that third-party software and devices modified to use the key will be able to decrypt and play back or store AirPlay streams.
  

    [21]
   

  Laird released ShairPort as an example of an audio-only software receiver implementation of AirPlay.
  

    [22]
   

  Soon more followed and in 2012 the first AirPlay audio and video receiver for PC came with a product called AirServer.
