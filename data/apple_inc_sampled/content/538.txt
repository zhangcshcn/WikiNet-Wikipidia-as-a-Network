   GarageBand
  
  is a line of
  
   digital audio workstations
  
  for
  
   macOS
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  that allows users to create
  
   music
  
  or
  
   podcasts
  
  . GarageBand is developed and sold by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  for macOS, and is part of the
  
   iLife
  
  software suite. Its music and podcast creation system enables users to create multiple tracks with pre-made
  
   MIDI keyboards
  
  , pre-made
  
   loops
  
  , an array of various instrumental effects, and voice recordings.
 
  GarageBand supports many sound formats, though not those that are at
  
   8-bits
  
  or lower but can be made longer.
 


  GarageBand was developed by Apple under the direction of Dr. Gerhard Lengeling. Dr. Gerhard Lengeling was formerly from the German company
  
   Emagic
  
  , makers of
  
   Logic Audio
  
  . (Apple acquired Emagic in July 2002.)
 

   Steve Jobs
  
  announced the application in his keynote speech at the
  
   Macworld Conference & Expo
  
  in
  
   San Francisco
  
  on January 6, 2004. The musician
  
   John Mayer
  
  assisted with its demonstration.

  Apple announced GarageBand 2 at the 2005
  
   Macworld Conference & Expo
  
  on January 11, 2005. It shipped, as announced, around January 22, 2005. Notable new features included the abilities to view and edit music in
  
   musical notation
  
  . It was also possible to record up to 8 tracks at once and to fix timing and
  
   pitch
  
  of recordings. Apple added automation of track pan position, master volume, and the master pitch. Transposition of both audio and MIDI has been added by Apple along with the ability to import MIDI files.
 
  GarageBand 3, announced at 2006’s Macworld Conference & Expo, includes a '
  
   podcast
  
  studio', including the ability to use more than 200 effects and jingles, and integration with
  
   iChat
  
  for remote interviews.
 
  GarageBand 4, also known as GarageBand '08, is part of
  
   iLife
  
  '08. It incorporates the ability to record sections of a song separately, such as
  
   bridges
  
  , and
  
   chorus lines
  
  . Additionally, it provides support for the automation of
  
   tempos
  
  and instruments, the creation, and exportation of iPhone ringtones, and a "Magic GarageBand" feature which includes a virtual
  
   jam session
  
  with a complete 3D view of the Electric instruments.
 
  GarageBand 5 is part of the
  
   iLife
  
  '09 package. It includes music instruction and allows the user to buy instructional videos by contemporary artists. It also contains new features for electric guitar players, including a dedicated 3D Electric Guitar Track containing a virtual stompbox pedalboard, and
  
   virtual amplifiers
  
  with spring reverb and tremolo. GarageBand 5 also includes a cleaner, redesigned user interface as well as Project Templates.
 
  GarageBand 6, also known as GarageBand '11, is part of the
  
   iLife
  
  '11 package, which Apple released on October 20, 2010. This version brings new features such as Flex Time, a tool to adjust the rhythm of a recording. It also includes the ability to match the tempo of one track with another instantly, additional guitar amps and stompboxes, 22 new lessons for guitar and piano, and "How Did I Play?", a tool to measure the accuracy and progress of a piano or guitar performance in a lesson.

  Apple released GarageBand 10 along with OS X 10.9 Mavericks in October 2013. This version has lost Magic GarageBand and the podcast functionality.
 
  Apple updated GarageBand 10 for Mac on March 20, 2014. Version 10.0.2 adds the ability to export tracks in MP3 format as well as a new drummer module, but removed support for podcasting; users with podcast files created in GarageBand 6 can continue to edit them using the older version.
  

    [2]
   


  Garageband updated to version 10.0.3 on 16 October 2014. This version included myriad bug fixes and several new features including a dedicated Bass Amp Designer, the introduction of global track effects and dynamic track resizing.

  GarageBand is a
  
   digital audio workstation
  
  (DAW) and
  
   music sequencer
  
  that can record and play back multiple tracks of audio. Built-in audio filters that use the
  
   AU
  
  (audio unit) standard allow the user to enhance the audio track with various effects, including reverb, echo, and distortion amongst others. GarageBand also offers the ability to record at both
  
   16-bit
  
  and
  
   24-bit
  
  Audio Resolution,
  

    [4]
   

  but at a fixed sample rate of 44.1 kHz.
  

    [5]
   

  An included tuning system helps with pitch correction and can effectively imitate the
  
   Auto-Tune
  
  effect when tuned to the maximum level. It also has a large array of preset effects to choose from, with an option to create your own effects.
 
  GarageBand includes a large selection of realistic, sampled instruments and software modeled
  
   synthesizers
  
  . These can be used to create original compositions or play music live through the use of a USB
  
   MIDI keyboard
  
  connected to the computer. An on-screen
  
   virtual
  

   keyboard
  
  is also available as well as using a standard
  
   QWERTY
  
  keyboard with the "musical typing" feature. The synthesizers were broken into two groups: [virtual] analog and digital. Each synthesizer has a wide variety of adjustable parameters, including richness, glide, cut off, standard attack, decay, sustain, and release; these allow for a wide array of sound creation.
 
  In addition to the standard tracks, Garageband allows for guitar-specific tracks that can use a variety of simulated amplifiers, stompboxes, and effects processors. These imitate popular hardware from companies including
  
   Marshall Amplification
  
  ,
  
   Orange Music Electronic Company
  
  , and
  
   Fender Musical Instruments Corporation
  
  . Up to five simulated effects can be layered on top of the virtual amplifiers, which feature adjustable parameters including tone, reverb, and volume. Guitars can be connected to Macs using the built-in input (requires hardware that can produce a standard stereo signal using a 3.5mm output) or a USB interface.
 
  GarageBand can import
  
   MIDI
  
  files and offers piano roll or notation-style editing and playback. By complying with the MIDI Standard, a user can edit many different aspects of a recorded note, including pitch, velocity, and duration. Pitch was settable to 1/128 of a semitone, on a scale of 0–127 (sometimes described on a scale of 1–128 for clarity). Velocity, which determines amplitude (volume), can be set and adjusted on a scale of 0–127. Note duration can be adjusted manually via the piano roll or in the score view. Note rhythms can be played via the software instruments, or created in the piano roll environment; rhythm correction is also included to lock notes to any time signature subdivision. GarageBand also offers global editing capabilities to MIDI information with Enhanced Timing, also known as
  
   Quantizing
  
  .
  

    [6]
   

  While offering comprehensive control over MIDI files, GarageBand does not include several features of professional-level DAWs, such as a sequencer for drum tracks separate from the normal piano roll. However, many of these shortcomings have been addressed with each successive release of GarageBand. Also of note, MIDI sequences edited or created in GarageBand cannot be exported to other DAWs or programs without first being converted to audio.
 
  A new feature included with GarageBand '09 and later is the ability to download pre-recorded music lessons from GarageBand's
  
   Lesson Store
  
  for guitar and piano. There are two types of lesson available in the Lesson Store:
  
   Basic Lessons
  
  , which are a free download, and
  
   Artist Lessons
  
  , which a user must purchase. The first Basic Lessons for both guitar and piano are included with GarageBand. In GarageBand 10, many sounds (aka patches, which Apple refers to as 'audio units') which are listed within the sound library are dimmed and unusable until the user pays an additional fee which allows the utilization of those sounds, bundled with the guitar and piano lessons. Attempting to click on and select the dimmed audio units to apply to the track causes promotional prompts to appear, requiring the user to log on with their Apple ID and furnish credit card information before knowing the price of the bundle.
 
  In both types of the lesson, a music teacher presents the lesson, which is in a special format offering high-quality video and audio instructions. The lessons include a virtual guitar or piano, which demonstrates finger position and a musical notation area to show the correct musical notations. The music examples used in these lessons features popular music.
 
  In an
  
   Artist Lesson
  
  the music teacher is the actual musician/songwriter who composed the song being taught in the lesson. As of November 2009
  

    [update]
   

  the artists featured are:
 
  No new
  
   Artist Lessons
  
  were released in 2010, and Apple has not announced plans to release additional entries.
 
  Garageband includes an extensive array of pre-made audio loops to choose from with an option to import custom sound loops and an additional loop pack that is purchasable via the App Store. All loops have an edit and effects option.
 
  Jam Packs are Apple’s official add-ons for GarageBand. Each Jam Pack contains loops and software instruments grouped into certain genres and styles.
 
  The current Jam Packs are as follows:
 
  There was also another GarageBand Jam Pack, initially known just as GarageBand Jam Pack, later GarageBand Jam Pack 1, which Apple discontinued in January 2006. Beginning with the release of the Remix Tools and Rhythm Section Jam Packs, each Jam Pack has been designated with a number. The release of GarageBand Jam Pack: World Music also saw a redesign in packaging.
 
  MainStage 2 by Apple also includes 40 built-in instruments – including synths, vintage keyboards, and a drum machine – to use in GarageBand. It also features an interface for live performances and includes a large collection of plug-ins and sounds.
  

    [7]
   


  In addition to Apple, many other companies today offer commercial or shareware virtual software instruments designed especially for GarageBand, and collections of Apple Loops intended for GarageBand users.
 
  GarageBand can also use any third-party
  
   software synthesizer
  
  that adheres to the Core Audio (
  
   Audio Units
  
  ) standard. However, there are limitations, including that Audio Unit instruments which can respond to multiple MIDI channels or ports can be triggered only on the first channel of the first port. This means that multi-timbral instruments which contain multiple channels and respond to many MIDI channels, such as
  
   Native Instruments
  

   Kontakt
  
  and
  
   MOTU
  
  MachFive, are not ideally suited for use in GarageBand.
 
  Third-party vendors also offer extra loops for use in GarageBand. Users can also record custom loops through a
  
   microphone
  
  , via a software instrument, or by using an audio interface to connect physically a
  
   guitar
  
  or other hardware instruments to a Mac or iOS device.
 
  In 2005,
  
   Trent Reznor
  
  from the band
  
   Nine Inch Nails
  
  released the source multitrack GarageBand files for the song "The Hand That Feeds" to allow the public to experiment with his music, and permitted prospective GarageBand users to remix the song. He also gave permission for anyone to share their personalized remix with the world. Since then, Nine Inch Nails has released several more GarageBand source files, and several other artists have also released their GarageBand files that the public could use to experiment. (For more information, and to download the source files for that song and others, visit
  
   [1]
  
  ).
 
  New Zealand band
  
   Evermore
  
  also released the source multi-track files for GarageBand for their song "
  
   Never Let You Go
  
  ".
 

   Ben Folds
  
  released
  

    Stems & Seeds
   

  , special version of his 2008 album,
  

    Way to Normal
   

  .
  
   Stems and Seeds
  
  contained a remastered version of
  
   Way to Normal
  
  , and a separate disc containing GarageBand files for each track from the album to allow fans to remix the songs.
 
  A lack of MIDI-out capability limits the use of external MIDI instruments. There is also only limited support for messages sent from knobs on MIDI keyboards, as only real-time pitch bend, modulation, sustain, and foot control is recognizable. However, since GarageBand '08, other parameters affected by
  
   MIDI
  
  knobs can be automated later, per-track. GarageBand has no functions for changing time signature mid-song though the software does now allow a tempo track to automate tempo changes. The ability to reverse tracks is also not available.
 
  Other than pitch bend, GarageBand is limited to the pitches and intervals of standard 12-tone
  
   equal temperament
  
  , so it does not natively support
  
   xenharmonic music
  
  .
  
   Logic Pro
  
  supports many different tunings.
  

    [8]
   

  GarageBand does not support different tunings however, audio units which support micro tuning (using .scl or .tun files, or some other method) can be employed in GarageBand to produce alternative pitches.
 
  Before GarageBand 10, there was no MIDI export option, and the only option was to save files as .band or export to iTunes.
 
  On March 2, 2011, Apple announced a version of GarageBand for the
  
   iPad
  
  .
  

    [9]
   

  It has many features similar to the
  
   macOS
  
  version. Music can be created using the on-screen instruments, which include keyboards,
  
   drums
  
  , a
  
   sampler
  
  , and various "smart instruments". It also acts as a multitrack recording studio with
  
   Stompbox
  
  effects and guitar amps. Songs can be emailed or sent to an iTunes Library. Additionally, projects can be imported to GarageBand for macOS, where they are further editable. This feature also allows instruments from the iOS platform to be savable to software instrument library on the Mac. The app is compatible with
  
   iPhone 3GS
  
  or higher, the third generation
  
   iPod Touch
  
  or higher, and all versions of the iPad, including the
  
   iPad Mini
  
  . The app, with all instruments included, is available for $6.99 from the Apple App Store.
 
  On November 1, 2011, Apple introduced GarageBand for iOS 1.1, adding support for the iPhone and iPod touch, among other features. These included the ability to create custom chords for Smart Instruments, support for 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures, and exporting in
  
   AAC
  
  or
  
   AIFF
  
  format.
  

    [10]
   


  On March 7, 2012, Apple updated GarageBand to 1.2, adding support for the
  
   third-generation iPad
  
  . It introduced the new Smart Strings instrument, a string orchestra of
  
   1st and 2nd violins
  
  ,
  
   violas
  
  ,
  
   celli
  
  , and
  
   bass
  
  , capable of playing notes
  
   legato
  
  ,
  
   staccato
  
  , and
  
   pizzicato
  
  . Additionally, it added
  
   synthesizers
  
  to the Smart Keyboard and Smart Bass instruments. It also added a note editor which allows users to fine-tune note placement and length and the ability to upload songs to
  
   Facebook
  
  ,
  
   YouTube
  
  and
  
   SoundCloud
  
  , as well as the ability to upload projects to iCloud. It also included Jam Session, a feature that enables up to 4 iPhones, iPod touches, and/or iPads with GarageBand installed to play simultaneously.
 
  On May 1, 2012, GarageBand was updated to 1.2.1, providing minor bug fixes and stability improvements.
  

    [11]
   


  Alongside the new
  
   iOS 6
  
  , Apple updated GarageBand to 1.3 on September 19, 2012. The update added the ability to import music from one's music library,
  
   ringtone
  
  creation, the ability to use the app in the background, and minor bug fixes.
  

    [12]
   


  GarageBand was updated to 1.4 on March 20, 2013. The update added support for Audiobus, the ability to remove grid snapping, and minor bug fixes.
  

    [13]
   


  GarageBand received an overhaul of design coinciding with the reveal of the
  
   iPad Air
  
  on October 22, 2013. GarageBand 2.0 features a new design to match
  
   iOS 7
  
  , an extended number of tracks per song, and new functions in the Sampler instrument.
  

    [14]
   


  In 2016, Garageband received a new design, and in January 2017 version 2.2 was released with a number of new features including the Alchemy synth previously only available on the desktop version.
 
  Prior to the launch of Apple's
  
   Mac App Store
  
  , GarageBand was only available as a part of
  
   iLife
  
  , a suite of applications (also including
  
   iPhoto
  
  ,
  
   iMovie
  
  ,
  
   iDVD
  
  , and
  
   iWeb
  
  ) intended to simplify the creation and organization of digital content, or available on a new Mac. On January 6, 2011, GarageBand was made available independently on the Mac App Store in addition to iPhoto and iMovie.
  

    [15]
   


  This app can support any music format, including AIFF, WAV, and MIDI. The app can export songs to MP3, MP4 or AIFF format.
 
  In the new update, GarageBand 10.0 cannot support 8-bit sounds, but can support 16-bit sounds and greater.
