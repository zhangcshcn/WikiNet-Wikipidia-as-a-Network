  The
  
   Apple S1
  
  is the integrated computer in the
  
   Apple Watch
  
  , and it is described as a "
  
   System in Package
  
  " (SiP) by
  
   Apple Inc
  
  .

   Samsung
  
  is said to be the main supplier of key components, such as the
  
   RAM
  
  and
  
   NAND flash
  
  storage, and the assembly itself,
  

    [7]
   

  but early teardowns reveal RAM and flash memory from
  
   Toshiba
  
  and
  
   Micron Technology
  
  .

  It uses a customized
  
   application processor
  
  that together with
  
   memory
  
  ,
  
   storage
  
  and support processors for wireless connectivity, sensors and
  
   I/O
  
  constitute a complete computer in a single package. This package is filled with
  
   resin
  
  for durability.

  From reverse engineering, the processor handling the
  
   Wi-Fi
  
  and
  
   Bluetooth
  
  is a
  
   Broadcom
  
  BCM43342
  

    [9]
   

  and the six-axis
  
   gyroscope
  
  is from
  
   STMicroelectronics
  
  .

  The SiP in Apple Watch Series 1 is called
  
   S1P
  
  and looks superficially identical to the S1, and it includes most of the new features of the
  
   Apple S2
  
  except notably for the on-chip
  
   GPS
  
  functionality. It contains the same dual-core CPU with the same new
  
   GPU
  
  capabilities as the S2 making it about 50% faster than the S1.

  The S1 was announced on 9 September 2014 as part of the "Wish we could say more" event.
 
  The S1P was announced on 7 September 2016 as part of the "See you on the 7th" event.
 
  The S1 made its first appearance within the Apple Watch, which arrived in April 2015.

    [13]
   

  The S1 was discontinued with the launch of Apple Watch Series 1, containing the S1P.
 
  The S1P was released with the Apple Watch Series 1 16 September 2016.

      The S1P package shows little of the differences that's encapsulated inside.
     
      This illustration shows the positions of the chips and other components inside the S1 package.

      This is how large the S1 is compared to the Apple Watch case.
