   Radeon Pro
  
  is
  
   AMD
  
  's brand of professional oriented
  
   GPUs
  
  . It replaced AMD's
  
   FirePro
  
  brand in 2016. Compared to the
  
   Radeon
  
  brand for mainstream consumer/gamer products, the Radeon Pro brand is intended for use in
  
   workstations
  
  and the running of
  
   computer-aided design
  
  (CAD),
  
   computer-generated imagery
  
  (CGI),
  
   digital content creation
  
  (DCC),
  
   high-performance computing
  
  /
  
   GPGPU
  
  applications, and the creation and running of
  
   virtual reality
  
  programs and games.

  The Radeon Pro product line directly competes with
  
   Nvidia
  
  's
  
   Quadro
  
  and
  
   Tesla
  
  lines of professional workstation cards.

  The first card to be released under the Radeon Pro name was the dual GPU
  

    Radeon Pro Duo
   

  in April 2016. The card features two liquid cooled
  
   Fury X
  
  cores and was marketed strongly for both the running and creation of virtual reality content with the slogan â€³For Gamers Who Create and Creators Who Game".

  The aesthetics and marketing of the
  
   Pro Duo
  
  follow that of the rest of the
  
   Fury
  
  products in the
  

    300 series
   

  .
 
  Using AMD Radeon's
  
   GCN 1.2 architecture
  
  , the
  
   Radeon Pro SSG
  
  was unveiled in July 2016. SSG stands for
  
   S
  
  olid
  
   S
  
  tate
  
   G
  
  raphics, and the card will couple AMD's
  
   Fiji
  
  core with
  
   Solid-state storage
  
  to increase the frame buffer for rendering. This expansion of quick access storage will, therefore, relieve the issue of latency that occurs when a GPU has to retrieve information from a mass storage device via the CPU when a card's limited
  
   VRAM
  
  is maxed out in heavy workloads.
  

    [5]
   

  Users will be able to add up to 1TB of
  
   PCIe
  

   M.2
  

   NAND flash memory
  
  to improve render and scrubbing times.
  

    [6]
   

  AMD demonstrated a 5.3 fold increase in performance on
  
   8K
  
  video scrubbing.
  

    [7]
   

  This SSD storage space can be made available to the
  
   operating system
  
  or controlled entirely by the GPU.
  

    [8]
   

  The card is current available as a beta program, with general availability expected in 2017.

  The first Radeon Pro cards with the
  
   WX
  
  prefix to be announced were the
  
   WX 7100
  
  , the
  
   WX 5100
  
  and the
  
   WX 4100
  
  in July 2016.
  

    [2]
   

  These Polaris based cards are once again aimed at the traditional professional market and are set to replace the
  
   FirePro Wx100 series
  
  and
  
   FirePro Wx300 series
  
  . These cards, along with the Pro SSG, will use the new, non-toxic and energy efficient
  
   YInMn Blue
  
  , discovered by
  
   Mas Subramanian
  
  . This unique aesthetic for the Radeon Pro line will distinguish the professional products from the consumer
  
   Radeon
  
  series.
  

    [11]
   


  The smallest card, the half-height
  
   WX 4100
  
  , is marketed for use in
  
   small form factor
  

   workstations
  
  .
  

    [12]
   

  Designed for real-time content engines and CAD and CAM manufacturing, the
  
   WX 5100
  
  fits in between the
  
   WX 4100
  
  and the
  
   WX 7100
  
  in terms of performance, with the latter once again marketed with emphasis on the application of VR and other media creation, while claiming to be "The Most Affordable Workstation Solution".

  Mobile Radeon Pro parts were first revealed with the release of the 2016 update to the
  
   Apple
  
  15"
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  .
  

    [13]
   

  These appear to be
  
   Polaris 11
  
  derived parts with 10-16
  
   4th generation GCN
  

   compute units
  
  , providing between 1 and 1.86
  
   TFLOPS
  
  of performance.

  At an AMD event in 2016 Project Loom was announced as a collaboration between AMD and Radiant Images.
  

    [16]
   

  The real-time
  
   GPU accelerated
  
  photo and video stitching program will complement AMD's virtual reality development platform. While traditional photo stitching is not that much of a complex task, Project Loom aims to improve render times when tasked with the heavy workload of stitching together multiple high resolution angles to form a 360 degree VR experience, either to headsets or mobile devices.
  

    [17]
   

  Using AMD's Direct GMA protocol, the software allows Radeon Pro graphics cards to work directly with video capture hardware to stitch together a 30 fps, 360 degree 4k resolution video from 24, 1080p cameras at 60 fps.
  

    [18]
   


  The software is to be competitive with
  
   Nvidia's
  
  VRWorks 360 Video SDK, and is reportedly set to be made open-source through GPUOpen.
  

    [19]
   


  The successor to FireRender, Radeon ProRender works with high-end graphics programs as an
  
   OpenCL
  
  photorealistic offline 3D renderer and raytracing engine.
  

    [20]
   

  ProRender aims to compete with programs such as NVIDIA's iRay and other expensive, proprietary solutions. However, AMD is making ProRender free, open source and available for all graphics hardware.
