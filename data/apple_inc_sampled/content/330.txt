   Unix-like
  
  computer
  
   operating system
  
  assembled under the model of
  
   free and open-source software
  
  development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the
  
   Linux kernel
  
  ,
  

    [12]
   

  an
  
   operating system kernel
  
  first released on September 17, 1991 by
  
   Linus Torvalds
  
  .
  

    [13]
   



    [14]
   



    [15]
   

  The
  
   Free Software Foundation
  
  uses the name
  

    GNU
   
   /Linux
  
  to describe the operating system, which has led to some
  
   controversy
  
  .
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   


  Linux was originally developed for
  
   personal computers
  
  based on the
  
   Intel x86
  
  architecture, but has since been
  
   ported
  
  to more
  
   platforms
  
  than any other operating system.
  

    [18]
   

  Because of the dominance of
  
   Android
  
  on
  
   smartphones
  
  , Linux has the
  
   largest
  

   installed base
  
  of all
  
   general-purpose operating systems
  
  .
  

    [19]
   

  Linux is also the leading operating system on
  
   servers
  
  and other
  
   big iron
  
  systems such as
  
   mainframe computers
  
  , and is used on 99.6% of the
  
   TOP500
  

   supercomputers
  
  .
  

    [20]
   



    [21]
   

  It is used by around 2.3% of
  
   desktop computers
  
  .
  

    [22]
   



    [23]
   

  The
  
   Chromebook
  
  , which runs on
  
   Chrome OS
  
  , dominates the US
  
   K–12
  
  education market and represents nearly 20% of the sub-$300
  
   notebook
  
  sales in the US.
  

    [24]
   

  Linux also runs on
  
   embedded systems
  
  – devices whose
  
   operating system
  
  is typically built into the
  
   firmware
  
  and is highly tailored to the system. This includes
  
   TiVo
  
  and similar
  
   DVR
  
  devices, network
  
   routers
  
  , facility automation controls, televisions,
  

    [25]
   



    [26]
   


   video game consoles
  
  and
  
   smartwatches
  
  .
  

    [27]
   

  Many smartphones and
  
   tablet computers
  
  run Android and other Linux derivatives.
  

    [28]
   


  The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source
  
   software
  
  collaboration. The underlying
  
   source code
  
  may be used, modified and distributed‍—‌commercially or non-commercially‍—‌by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  . Typically, Linux is
  
   packaged
  
  in a form known as a
  

    Linux distribution
   

  (or
  
   distro
  
  for short) for both desktop and server use. Some of the most popular mainstream Linux distributions
  

    [29]
   



    [30]
   



    [31]
   

  are
  
   Arch Linux
  
  ,
  
   CentOS
  
  ,
  
   Debian
  
  ,
  
   Fedora
  
  ,
  
   Gentoo Linux
  
  ,
  
   Linux Mint
  
  ,
  
   Mageia
  
  ,
  
   openSUSE
  
  and
  
   Ubuntu
  
  , together with commercial distributions such as
  
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  
  and
  
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
  
  . Distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting
  
   utilities
  
  and
  
   libraries
  
  , many of which are provided by the
  
   GNU Project
  
  , and usually a large amount of application software to fulfil the distribution's intended use.
 
  Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system, such as
  
   X11
  
  ,
  
   Mir
  
  or a
  
   Wayland
  
  implementation, and an accompanying
  
   desktop environment
  
  such as
  
   GNOME
  
  or the
  
   KDE Software Compilation
  
  ; some distributions may also include a less resource-intensive desktop, such as
  
   LXDE
  
  or
  
   Xfce
  
  . Distributions intended to run on servers may omit all graphical environments from the standard install, and instead include other software to set up and operate a
  
   solution stack
  
  such as
  
   LAMP
  
  . Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any intended use.
 
  The
  
   Unix
  
  operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at
  
   AT&T
  
  's
  
   Bell Laboratories
  
  in the United States by
  
   Ken Thompson
  
  ,
  
   Dennis Ritchie
  
  ,
  
   Douglas McIlroy
  
  , and
  
   Joe Ossanna
  
  .
  

    [32]
   

  First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in
  
   assembly language
  
  , as was common practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the
  
   C
  
  programming language by
  
   Dennis Ritchie
  
  (with exceptions to the kernel and I/O). The availability of a
  
   high-level language
  
  implementation of Unix made its
  
   porting
  
  to different computer platforms easier.
 
  Due to an earlier
  
   antitrust case
  
  forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.
  

    [33]
   

  As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a
  
   proprietary
  
  product.
 
  The
  
   GNU Project
  
  , started in 1983 by
  
   Richard Stallman
  
  , has the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of
  
   free software
  
  . Work began in 1984.
  

    [34]
   

  Later, in 1985, Stallman started the
  
   Free Software Foundation
  
  and wrote the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries,
  
   compilers
  
  ,
  
   text editors
  
  , a
  
   Unix shell
  
  , and a
  
   windowing system
  
  ) were completed, although low-level elements such as
  
   device drivers
  
  ,
  
   daemons
  
  , and the
  
   kernel
  
  were stalled and incomplete.

  Linus Torvalds has stated that if the
  
   GNU kernel
  
  had been available at the time (1991), he would not have decided to write his own.
  

    [36]
   


  Although not released until 1992 due to
  
   legal complications
  
  , development of
  
   386BSD
  
  , from which
  
   NetBSD
  
  ,
  
   OpenBSD
  
  and
  
   FreeBSD
  
  descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has also stated that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.
  

    [37]
   



   MINIX
  
  was created by
  
   Andrew S. Tanenbaum
  
  , a
  
   computer science
  
  professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal
  
   Unix-like
  
  operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn the operating system principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being
  
   free software
  
  until the licensing changed in April 2000.
  

    [38]
   


  In 1991, while attending the
  
   University of Helsinki
  
  , Torvalds became curious about operating systems
  

    [39]
   

  and frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only.
  

    [38]
   

  He began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the
  
   Linux kernel
  
  .
 
  Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems.
  

    [40]
   

  GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL.
  

    [41]
   

  Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system.
  

    [35]
   


  Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "
  
   Freax
  
  ", a
  
   portmanteau
  
  of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's
  
   makefiles
  
  included the name "Freax" for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux", but initially dismissed it as too egotistical.
  

    [42]
   


  In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the
  
   FTP server
  
  (ftp.funet.fi) of
  
   FUNET
  
  in September 1991.
  
   Ari Lemmke
  
  , Torvalds' coworker at the
  
   Helsinki University of Technology
  
  (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that "Freax" was a good name. So, he named the project "Linux" on the server without consulting Torvalds.
  

    [42]
   

  Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux".
 
  To demonstrate how the word "Linux" should be pronounced (
  







       i
      





     /
     

       ˈ

  ), Torvalds included an audio guide (
  







     listen
    


    (
    

      help
     

    ·
    

      info
     

    )
   

  ) with the kernel source code.
  

    [43]
   

  Another variant of pronunciation is
  


     /
     

       ˈ
      

       l
      

       aɪ

  Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as
  
   NASA
  
  started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with
  
   clusters
  
  of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use followed when
  
   Dell
  
  and
  
   IBM
  
  , followed by
  
   Hewlett-Packard
  
  , started offering Linux support to escape
  
   Microsoft
  
  's monopoly in the desktop operating system market.
  

    [44]
   


  Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from
  
   embedded systems
  
  to
  
   supercomputers
  
  ,
  

    [21]
   



    [45]
   

  and have secured a place in
  
   server
  
  installations such as the popular
  
   LAMP
  
  application stack.
  

    [46]
   

  Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing.

  Linux distributions have also become popular in the
  
   netbook
  
  market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own
  
   Chrome OS
  
  designed for netbooks.
 
  Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with
  
   Android
  
  being one of the most dominant operating systems on
  
   smartphones
  
  and very popular on
  
   tablets
  
  and, more recently, on
  
   wearables
  
  . Linux gaming is also on the rise with
  
   Valve
  
  showing its support for Linux and rolling out its own gaming oriented Linux distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments, such as the federal government of
  
   Brazil
  
  .
  

    [54]
   


  Torvalds continues to direct the development of the kernel.
  

    [55]
   

  Stallman heads the Free Software Foundation,
  

    [56]
   

  which in turn supports the GNU components.
  

    [57]
   

  Finally, individuals and corporations develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries.
 
  Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and non-GNU components, with additional
  
   package management
  
  software in the form of
  
   Linux distributions
  
  .
 
  A Linux-based system is a modular
  
   Unix-like
  
  operating system, deriving much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a
  
   monolithic kernel
  
  , the
  
   Linux kernel
  
  , which handles process control, networking, access to the
  
   peripherals
  
  , and
  
   file systems
  
  .
  
   Device drivers
  
  are either integrated directly with the kernel, or added as modules that are loaded while the system is running.
  

    [58]
   


  Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system's higher-level functionality. The GNU
  
   userland
  
  is an important part of most Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the
  
   C library
  
  , a popular
  
   CLI
  

   shell
  
  , and many of the common
  
   Unix tools
  
  which carry out many basic operating system tasks. The
  
   graphical user interface
  
  (or GUI) used by most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the
  
   X Window System
  
  .
  

    [59]
   

  More recently, the Linux community seeks to advance to
  
   Wayland
  
  as the new display server protocol in place of
  
   X11
  
  ; Ubuntu, however, develops
  
   Mir
  
  instead of Wayland.
  

    [60]
   


  Installed components of a Linux system include the following:
  

    [59]
   



    [61]
   


  The
  
   user interface
  
  , also known as the
  
   shell
  
  , is either a
  
   command-line interface
  
  (CLI), a
  
   graphical user interface
  
  (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for
  
   embedded systems
  
  . For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is available through
  
   terminal emulator
  
  windows or on a separate
  
   virtual console
  
  .
 
  CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the
  
   Bourne-Again Shell
  
  (bash), originally developed for the
  
   GNU project
  
  . Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the
  
   userland
  
  , use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks, and provides very simple
  
   inter-process communication
  
  .
 
  On desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the
  
   GUI shells
  
  , packaged together with extensive
  
   desktop environments
  
  , such as the
  
   K Desktop Environment (KDE)
  
  ,
  
   GNOME
  
  ,
  
   MATE
  
  ,
  
   Cinnamon
  
  ,
  
   Unity
  
  ,
  
   LXDE
  
  ,
  
   Pantheon
  
  and
  
   Xfce
  
  , though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the
  
   X Window System
  
  , often simply called "X". It provides
  
   network transparency
  
  and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.
  

    [62]
   

  Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation,
  
   X.Org Server
  
  , being the most popular.
 
  Several types of
  
   window managers
  
  exist for X11, including
  
   tiling
  
  ,
  
   dynamic
  
  ,
  
   stacking
  
  and
  
   compositing
  
  . Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler
  
   X window managers
  
  such as
  
   dwm
  
  or
  
   ratpoison
  
  provide a
  
   minimalist
  
  functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as
  
   FVWM
  
  ,
  
   Enlightenment
  
  or
  
   Window Maker
  
  provide more features such as a built-in
  
   taskbar
  
  and
  
   themes
  
  , but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as
  
   Mutter
  
  (GNOME),
  
   KWin
  
  (KDE) or
  
   Xfwm
  
  (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.
 

   Wayland
  
  is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; as of 2014
  

    [update]
   

  , it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager. Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.
 
  Linux currently has two modern kernel-userspace APIs for handing video input devices:
  
   V4L2
  
  API for video streams and radio, and
  
   DVB
  
  API for digital TV reception.
  

    [63]
   


  Due to the complexity and diversity of different devices, and due to the large amount of formats and standards handled by those APIs, this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices. Also, a good userspace device library is the key of the success for having userspace applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those devices.
  

    [64]
   



    [65]
   


  The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the
  
   Linux kernel
  
  and other components are
  
   free
  
  and
  
   open-source software
  
  . Linux is not the only such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used.
  

    [66]
   

  Some
  
   free
  
  and
  
   open-source
  
  software licenses are based on the principle of
  
   copyleft
  
  , a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  (GPL), is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the
  
   GNU Project
  
  .
 
  Linux based distributions are intended by developers for
  
   interoperability
  
  with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to
  
   POSIX
  
  ,
  

    [67]
   


   SUS
  
  ,
  

    [68]
   


   LSB
  
  ,
  
   ISO
  
  , and
  
   ANSI
  
  standards where possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified, Linux-FT.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   


  Free software projects, although developed through
  
   collaboration
  
  , are often produced independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.
 
  Many Linux distributions, or "distros", manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a
  
   package manager
  
  such as
  
   apt
  
  ,
  
   yum
  
  ,
  
   zypper
  
  ,
  
   pacman
  
  or
  
   portage
  
  to install, remove, and update all of a system's software from one central location.
 
  A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis,
  
   Debian
  
  being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as
  
   Red Hat
  
  does with
  
   Fedora
  
  , and
  
   SUSE
  
  does with
  
   openSUSE
  
  .
 
  In many cities and regions, local associations known as
  
   Linux User Groups
  
  (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have
  
   IRC
  
  chatrooms or
  
   newsgroups
  
  .
  
   Online forums
  
  are another means for support, with notable examples being
  
   LinuxQuestions.org
  
  and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for
  
   Ubuntu
  
  ,
  
   Fedora
  
  , and
  
   Gentoo
  
  . Linux distributions host
  
   mailing lists
  
  ; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.
 
  There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle
  
   cover disks
  
  that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.

  Although Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of
  
   free software
  
  . An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified.
  

    [73]
   

  Major corporations that provide contributions include
  
   Dell
  
  ,
  
   IBM
  
  ,
  
   HP
  
  ,
  
   Oracle
  
  ,
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  (now part of Oracle) and
  
   Nokia
  
  . A number of corporations, notably Red Hat,
  
   Canonical
  
  and
  
   SUSE
  
  , have built a significant business around Linux distributions.
 
  The
  
   free software licenses
  
  , on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as
  
   symbiotic
  
  . One common
  
   business model
  
  of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.
 
  Another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as
  
   CP/M
  
  ,
  
   Apple DOS
  
  and versions of
  
   Mac OS
  
  prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.
 
  Linux distributions support dozens of
  
   programming languages
  
  . The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the
  
   GNU toolchain
  
  , which includes the
  
   GNU Compiler Collection
  
  (GCC) and the
  
   GNU Build System
  
  . Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for
  
   Ada
  
  ,
  
   C
  
  ,
  
   C++
  
  ,
  
   Go
  
  and
  
   Fortran
  
  . Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example
  
   PHP
  
  ,
  
   Perl
  
  ,
  
   Ruby
  
  ,
  
   Python
  
  ,
  
   Java
  
  , Go,
  
   Rust
  
  and
  
   Haskell
  
  . First released in 2003, the
  
   LLVM
  
  project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages.
  
   Proprietary
  
  compilers for Linux include the
  
   Intel C++ Compiler
  
  ,
  
   Sun Studio
  
  , and IBM XL
  
   C
  
  /
  
   C++
  
  Compiler.
  
   BASIC
  
  in the form of
  
   Visual Basic
  
  is supported in such forms as
  
   Gambas
  
  ,
  
   FreeBASIC
  
  , and
  
   XBasic
  
  , and in terms of terminal programming or
  
   QuickBASIC
  
  or
  
   Turbo BASIC
  
  programming in the form of
  
   QB64
  
  .
 
  A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at
  
   scripting
  
  , text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support
  
   shell scripts
  
  ,
  
   awk
  
  ,
  
   sed
  
  and
  
   make
  
  . Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example,
  
   regular expressions
  
  are supported in programs like
  
   grep
  
  and
  
   locate
  
  , the traditional Unix
  
   MTA
  

   Sendmail
  
  contains its own
  
   Turing complete
  
  scripting system, and the advanced text editor
  
   GNU Emacs
  
  is built around a general purpose
  
   Lisp
  
  interpreter.
 
  Most distributions also include support for
  
   PHP
  
  ,
  
   Perl
  
  ,
  
   Ruby
  
  ,
  
   Python
  
  and other
  
   dynamic languages
  
  . While not as common, Linux also supports
  
   C#
  
  (via
  
   Mono
  
  ),
  
   Vala
  
  , and
  
   Scheme
  
  .
  
   Guile Scheme
  
  acts as an
  
   extension language
  
  targeting the
  
   GNU
  
  system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small,
  
   static
  
  ,
  
   compiled
  

   C
  
  programs of
  
   Unix design
  
  rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant,
  
   functional
  
  high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile
  
   bindings
  
  to this end. A number of
  
   Java Virtual Machines
  
  and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM (
  
   HotSpot
  
  ), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like
  
   Kaffe
  
  and
  
   JikesRVM
  
  .
 

   GNOME
  
  and
  
   KDE
  
  are popular
  
   desktop environments
  
  and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the
  
   GTK+
  
  and
  
   Qt
  

   widget toolkits
  
  , respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of
  
   Integrated development environments
  
  available including
  
   Anjuta
  
  ,
  
   Code::Blocks
  
  ,
  
   CodeLite
  
  ,
  
   Eclipse
  
  ,
  
   Geany
  
  ,
  
   ActiveState Komodo
  
  ,
  
   KDevelop
  
  ,
  
   Lazarus
  
  ,
  
   MonoDevelop
  
  ,
  
   NetBeans
  
  , and
  
   Qt Creator
  
  , while the long-established editors
  
   Vim
  
  ,
  
   nano
  
  and
  
   Emacs
  
  remain popular.

  The Linux kernel is a widely
  
   ported
  
  operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of
  
   computer architectures
  
  , including the hand-held
  
   ARM
  
  -based
  
   iPAQ
  
  and the
  
   IBM
  

   mainframes
  

   System z9
  
  or
  
   System z10
  
  .
  

    [75]
   

  Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the
  
   ELKS
  
  kernel
  
   fork
  
  can run on
  
   Intel 8086
  
  or
  
   Intel 80286
  

   16-bit
  
  microprocessors, while the
  
   µClinux
  
  kernel fork may run on systems without a
  
   memory management unit
  
  . The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as
  
   Macintosh
  
  computers (with both
  
   PowerPC
  
  and
  
   Intel
  
  processors),
  
   PDAs
  
  ,
  
   video game consoles
  
  ,
  
   portable music players
  
  , and mobile phones.
 
  There are several industry associations and hardware
  
   conferences
  
  devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as
  
   FreedomHEC
  
  . Over time, support for different hardware has improved in Linux, resulting in any off-the-shelf purchase having a "good chance" of being compatible.
  

    [76]
   


  Beside the Linux distributions designed for general-purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including:
  
   computer architecture
  
  support,
  
   embedded systems
  
  , stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for
  
   real-time
  
  applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only
  
   free software
  
  . As of 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , over four hundred Linux distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.
  

    [77]
   


  The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years.
  

    [78]
   

  Most modern distributions include a graphical user environment, with, as of February 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , the two most popular environments being the
  
   KDE Plasma Desktop
  
  and
  
   Xfce
  
  .
  

    [79]
   


  No single official Linux desktop exists: rather desktop environments and Linux distributions select components from a pool of
  
   free and open-source software
  
  with which they construct a GUI implementing some more or less strict design guide. GNOME, for example, has its
  
   human interface guidelines
  
  as a design guide, which gives the
  
   human–machine interface
  
  an important role, not just when doing the graphical design, but also when considering people with
  
   disabilities
  
  , and even when focusing on security.
  

    [80]
   


  The collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform
  
   language localization
  
  of some Linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost-effective. For example, the
  
   Sinhalese language
  
  version of the
  
   Knoppix
  
  distribution became available significantly before Microsoft translated
  
   Windows XP
  
  into Sinhalese.
  

    [81]
   

  In this case the
  
   Lanka Linux User Group
  
  played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors,
  
   linguists
  
  , and local developers.
 
  The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic;
  
   [
   


      citation needed
     


   ]
  
  for example in 2007
  
   Con Kolivas
  
  accused the Linux community of favoring performance on servers. He quit Linux kernel development out of frustration with this lack of focus on the desktop, and then gave a "tell all" interview on the topic.
  

    [82]
   

  Since then a significant amount of development has focused on improving the desktop experience. Projects such as
  
   Upstart
  
  and
  
   systemd
  
  aim for a faster boot time; the Wayland and Mir projects aim at replacing
  
   X11
  
  while enhancing desktop performance, security and appearance.
  

    [83]
   


  Many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems. For example,
  
   Mozilla Firefox
  
  ,
  
   OpenOffice.org
  
  /
  
   LibreOffice
  
  and
  
   Blender
  
  have downloadable versions for all major operating systems. Furthermore, some applications initially developed for Linux, such as
  
   Pidgin
  
  , and
  
   GIMP
  
  , were ported to other operating systems (including
  
   Windows
  
  and
  
   Mac OS X
  
  ) due to their popularity. In addition, a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on Linux,
  

    [84]
   

  such as
  
   Autodesk Maya
  
  , Softimage XSI and
  
   Apple Shake
  
  in the high-end field of animation and visual effects; see the
  
   list of proprietary software for Linux
  
  for more details. There are also
  
   several companies
  
  that have ported their own or other companies' games to Linux, with Linux also being a supported platform on both the popular
  
   Steam
  
  and
  
   Desura
  
  digital-distribution services.
  

    [85]
   


  Many other types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X also run on Linux. Commonly, either a
  
   free software
  
  application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux, such as with
  
   Skype
  
  and some
  
   video games
  
  like
  

    Dota 2
   

  and
  

    Team Fortress 2
   

  . Furthermore, the
  
   Wine
  
  project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. It is sponsored by commercial interests including
  
   CodeWeavers
  
  , which produces a commercial version of the software. Since 2009, Google has also provided funding to the Wine project.
  

    [86]
   



    [87]
   


   CrossOver
  
  , a proprietary solution based on the open-source Wine project, supports running Windows versions of
  
   Microsoft Office
  
  ,
  
   Intuit
  
  applications such as
  
   Quicken
  
  and
  
   QuickBooks
  
  ,
  
   Adobe Photoshop
  
  versions through CS2, and many popular games such as
  

    World of Warcraft
   

  . In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as
  
   desktop publishing
  


    [88]
   

  and
  
   professional audio
  
  ,
  

    [89]
   



    [90]
   



    [91]
   

  there is equivalent software available on Linux.
 
  Besides externally visible components, such as
  
   X window managers
  
  , a non-obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by
  
   freedesktop.org
  
  , such as
  
   D-Bus
  
  or
  
   PulseAudio
  
  ; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit (
  
   GTK+
  
  or
  
   Qt
  
  ). A
  
   display server
  
  is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the
  
   X.Org Server
  
  and
  
   Xlib
  
  . Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol,
  
   Wayland
  
  .
 
  Installing, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the
  
   Synaptic Package Manager
  
  ,
  
   PackageKit
  
  , and
  
   Yum Extender
  
  . While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.

  Linux distributions have also become popular in the
  
   netbook
  
  market, with many devices such as the
  
   Asus Eee PC
  
  and
  
   Acer Aspire One
  
  shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.
  

    [92]
   


  In 2009, Google announced its
  
   Chrome OS
  
  as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the
  
   Chrome browser
  
  as the main user interface. Chrome OS does not run any non-web applications, except for the bundled file manager and media player (a certain level of support for
  
   Android
  
  applications was added in later versions).
  

    [93]
   

  The netbooks that shipped with the operating system, termed
  
   Chromebooks
  
  , started appearing on the market in June 2011.
  

    [94]
   



   Linux distributions
  
  have long been used as
  
   server
  
  operating systems, and have risen to prominence in that area;
  
   Netcraft
  
  reported in September 2006, that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their
  
   web servers
  
  .
  

    [95]
   

  In June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten,
  
   FreeBSD
  
  three of ten, and
  
   Microsoft
  
  two of ten;
  

    [96]
   

  since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, FreeBSD two of ten, and Microsoft one of ten.
  

    [97]
   


  Linux distributions are the cornerstone of the
  
   LAMP
  
  server-software combination (Linux,
  
   Apache
  
  ,
  
   MariaDB
  
  /
  
   MySQL
  
  ,
  
   Perl
  
  /
  
   PHP
  
  /
  
   Python
  
  ) which has achieved popularity among developers, and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting.
  

    [98]
   


  Linux distributions have become increasingly popular on
  
   mainframes
  
  , partly due to pricing and the open-source model.
  

    [99]
   

  In December 2009, computer giant
  
   IBM
  
  reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframe-based Enterprise Linux Server.
  

    [100]
   

  At
  
   LinuxCon North America 2015
  
  , IBM announced
  
   LinuxONE
  
  , a series of mainframes specifically designed to run Linux and open-source software.
  

    [101]
   



    [102]
   


  Linux distributions are also most commonly used as
  
   operating systems
  
  for supercomputers;
  

    [21]
   

  in the decade since the
  
   Earth Simulator
  
  supercomputer, all the fastest supercomputers have used Linux. As of November 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , 99.6% of the world's
  
   500 fastest supercomputers
  
  run some variant of Linux,
  

    [103]
   

  (the only exceptions, are ranked 386th and 387th and they run AIX Unix).
  

    [104]
   

  Linux is also dominant on the
  
   Green500
  
  list.
 
  Several operating systems for
  
   smart devices
  
  , such as
  
   smartphones
  
  ,
  
   tablet computers
  
  ,
  
   smart TVs
  
  , and
  
   in-vehicle infotainment
  
  (IVI) systems, are based on Linux. Major platforms for such systems include
  
   Android
  
  ,
  
   Firefox OS
  
  ,
  
   Mer
  
  and
  
   Tizen
  
  .
 
  Android has become the dominant mobile operating system for
  
   smartphones
  
  , running on 79.3% of units sold worldwide during the second quarter of 2013.
  

    [105]
   

  Android is also a popular operating system for tablets, and Android smart TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems have also appeared in the market.
 
  Cellphones and PDAs running Linux on open-source platforms became more common from 2007; examples include the
  
   Nokia N810
  
  ,
  
   Openmoko
  
  's
  
   Neo1973
  
  , and the
  
   Motorola ROKR E8
  
  . Continuing the trend,
  
   Palm
  
  (later acquired by
  
   HP
  
  ) produced a new Linux-derived operating system,
  
   webOS
  
  , which is built into its line of
  
   Palm Pre
  
  smartphones.
 

   Nokia
  
  's
  
   Maemo
  
  , one of the earliest mobile operating systems, was based on
  
   Debian
  
  .
  

    [106]
   

  It was later merged with
  
   Intel
  
  's
  
   Moblin
  
  , another Linux-based operating system, to form
  
   MeeGo
  
  .
  

    [107]
   

  The project was later terminated in favor of Tizen, an operating system targeted at mobile devices as well as IVI. Tizen is a project within
  
   The Linux Foundation
  
  . Several
  
   Samsung
  
  products are already running Tizen,
  
   Samsung Gear 2
  
  being the most significant example.
  

    [108]
   


   Samsung Z
  
  smartphones will use Tizen instead of Android.
  

    [109]
   


  As a result of MeeGo's termination, the Mer project forked the MeeGo codebase to create a basis for mobile-oriented operating systems.
  

    [110]
   

  In July 2012,
  
   Jolla
  
  announced
  
   Sailfish OS
  
  , their own mobile operating system built upon Mer technology.
 

   Mozilla's
  
  Firefox OS consists of the Linux kernel, a
  
   hardware abstraction layer
  
  , a
  
   web-standards
  
  -based
  
   runtime environment
  
  and user interface, and an integrated
  
   web browser
  
  .
  

    [111]
   



   Canonical
  
  has released
  
   Ubuntu Touch
  
  , aiming to bring convergence to the user experience on this mobile operating system and its desktop counterpart,
  
   Ubuntu
  
  . The operating system also provides a full Ubuntu desktop when connected to an external monitor.
  

    [112]
   


  Due to its low cost and ease of customization,
  
   Linux
  
  is often used in
  
   embedded systems
  
  . In the non-mobile telecommunications equipment sector, the majority of
  
   customer-premises equipment
  
  (CPE) hardware runs some Linux-based operating system.
  
   OpenWrt
  
  is a community driven example upon which many of the OEM firmwares are based.
 
  For example, the popular
  
   TiVo
  
  digital video recorder also uses a customized Linux,
  

    [114]
   

  as do several network
  
   firewalls
  
  and
  
   routers
  
  from such makers as
  
   Cisco
  
  /
  
   Linksys
  
  . The

  In the past, not many games were available for Linux, but in the recent years, more games have been released with support for Linux. Nowadays, many games support Linux (especially
  
   Indie games
  
  ), except for a few
  
   AAA title
  
  games. On the other hand, as a popular mobile platform,
  
   Android
  
  (which uses the
  
   Linux kernel
  
  ) has gained much developer interest and is one of the main platforms for mobile game development along with
  
   iOS
  
  operating system by
  
   Apple
  
  for
  
   iPhone
  
  and
  
   iPad
  
  devices.
 
  On February 14, 2013,
  
   Valve
  
  released a Linux version of
  
   Steam
  
  , a popular game distribution platform on PC.
  

    [117]
   

  Many Steam games were ported to Linux.
  

    [118]
   

  On December 13, 2013, Valve released
  
   SteamOS
  
  , a gaming oriented OS based on Debian, for
  
   beta testing
  
  , and has plans to ship
  
   Steam Machines
  
  as a gaming and entertainment platform.
  

    [119]
   

  Valve has also developed
  
   VOGL
  
  , an
  
   OpenGL
  
  debugger intended to aid video game development,
  

    [120]
   

  as well as porting its
  
   Source
  
  game engine to desktop Linux.
  

    [121]
   

  As a result of Valve's effort, several prominent games such as
  

    DotA 2
   

  ,
  

    Team Fortress 2
   

  ,
  

    Portal
   

  ,
  

    Portal 2
   

  and
  

    Left 4 Dead 2
   

  are now natively available on desktop Linux.
 
  On July 31, 2013,
  
   Nvidia
  
  released
  
   Shield
  
  as an attempt to use Android as a specialized gaming platform.
  

    [122]
   


  Some Linux users play Windows games through
  
   Wine
  
  or
  
   CrossOver Linux
  
  .
 
  Due to the flexibility, customizability and free and open-source nature of Linux, it becomes possible to highly tune Linux for a specific purpose. There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include
  
   Debian
  
  ,
  
   Fedora
  
  ,
  
   Ubuntu
  
  (which is itself based on Debian),
  
   Arch Linux
  
  ,
  
   Gentoo
  
  , and
  
   Slackware
  
  . In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the
  
   JeOS
  
  philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding
  
   resource
  
  overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.
 
  A
  
   home theater PC
  
  (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a
  
   Home theater system
  
  . It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.
 

   OpenELEC
  
  , a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software
  
   Kodi
  
  , is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.
 
  There are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the
  
   MythTV
  
  media center software, such as
  
   Mythbuntu
  
  , a special edition of Ubuntu.
 

   Kali Linux
  
  is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for
  
   digital forensics
  
  and
  
   penetration testing
  
  . It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying
  
   security exploits
  
  .
  

    [123]
   

  The Ubuntu derivative
  
   BackBox
  
  provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking.
 
  There are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including
  
   Tails
  
  ,
  
   Tin Hat Linux
  
  and
  
   Tinfoil Hat Linux
  
  .
  
   Lightweight Portable Security
  
  is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the
  
   United States Department of Defense
  
  .
  
   Tor-ramdisk
  
  is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software
  
   Tor
  
  .
 
  Linux
  
   Live CD
  
  sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use
  
   GParted
  
  as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:
 

   SpaceX
  
  uses multiple redundant
  
   flight computers
  
  in a
  
   fault-tolerant design
  
  in the
  
   Falcon 9
  
  rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three
  
   voting
  
  computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other's operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose.
  

    [124]
   

  For flexibility,
  
   commercial off-the-shelf
  
  parts and system-wide "radiation-tolerant" design are used instead of
  
   radiation hardened
  
  parts.
  

    [124]
   

  As of June 2015
  

    [update]
   

  , SpaceX has made 19 launches of the Falcon 9 since 2010, out of which 18 have successfully delivered their primary payloads to
  
   Earth orbit
  
  , including some support missions for the
  
   International Space Station
  
  .
 
  In addition, Windows was used as an operating system on non-mission critical systems‍—‌laptops used on board the space station, for example‍—‌but it has been replaced with Linux; the first Linux-powered humanoid robot is also undergoing in-flight testing.
  

    [125]
   


  The
  
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory
  
  has used Linux for a number of years "to help with projects relating to the construction of unmanned space flight and deep space exploration";
  
   NASA
  
  uses Linux in robotics in the Mars rover, and
  
   Ubuntu
  
  Linux to "save data from satellites".
  

    [126]
   


  Linux distributions have been created to provide hands-on experience with coding and source code to students, on devices such as the
  
   Raspberry Pi
  
  . In addition to producing a practical device, the intention is to show students "how things work under the hood".
 
  The Ubuntu derivatives
  
   Edubuntu
  
  and
  
   The Linux Schools Project
  
  , as well as the Debian derivative
  
   Skolelinux
  
  , provide education-oriented software packages. They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the
  
   Linux Terminal Server Project
  
  (LTSP).
 

   Instant WebKiosk
  
  and
  
   Webconverger
  
  are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web
  
   kiosks
  
  and
  
   digital signage
  
  .
  
   Thinstation
  
  is a minimalist distribution designed for
  
   thin clients
  
  .
  
   Rocks Cluster Distribution
  
  is tailored for
  
   high-performance computing clusters
  
  .
 
  There are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include
  
   Ubuntu Kylin
  
  for Chinese language users and
  
   BlankOn
  
  targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include
  
   Ubuntu Studio
  
  for media creation and
  
   DNALinux
  
  for
  
   bioinformatics
  
  . There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name
  
   Sabily
  
  , as well as an Arabic-focused distribution called
  
   Ojuba Linux
  
  that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including
  
   GendBuntu
  
  used by the French
  
   National Gendarmerie
  
  ,
  
   Goobuntu
  
  used internally by Google, and
  
   Astra Linux
  
  developed specifically for the Russian army.
 
  Many quantitative studies of
  
   free
  
  /open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux.
  

    [127]
   

  The Linux market is growing rapidly, and the revenue of servers, desktops, and packaged software running Linux was expected to
  
   [
   


      needs update
     


   ]
  
  exceed $35.7 billion by 2008.
  

    [128]
   

  Analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of Linux to its security, reliability, low cost, and freedom from
  
   vendor lock-in
  
  .
  

    [129]
   



    [130]
   


  Linux kernel is
  
   licensed
  
  under the
  
   GNU General Public License
  
  (GPL), version 2. The GPL requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license, must make the originating source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms.
  

    [153]
   

  Other key components of a typical Linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the GPL, but they may use other licenses; many libraries use the
  
   GNU Lesser General Public License
  
  (LGPL), a more permissive variant of the GPL, and the
  
   X.org
  
  implementation of the
  
   X Window System
  
  uses the
  
   MIT License
  
  .
 
  Torvalds states that the Linux kernel will not move from version 2 of the GPL to version 3.
  

    [154]
   



    [155]
   

  He specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in
  
   digital rights management
  
  .
  

    [156]
   

  It would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders, who number in the thousands.
  

    [157]
   


  A 2001 study of
  
   Red Hat Linux
  
  7.1 found that this distribution contained 30 million
  
   source lines of code
  
  .
  

    [158]
   

  Using the
  
   Constructive Cost Model
  
  , the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand man-years of development time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by conventional
  
   proprietary
  
  means, it would have cost about $1.5 billion (2017 US dollars) to develop in the United States.
  

    [158]
   

  Most of the source code (71%) was written in the
  
   C
  

   programming
  

   language
  
  , but many other languages were used, including
  
   C++
  
  ,
  
   Lisp
  
  ,
  
   assembly language
  
  ,
  
   Perl
  
  ,
  
   Python
  
  ,
  
   Fortran
  
  , and various
  
   shell scripting
  
  languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total.
  

    [158]
   


  In a later study, the same analysis was performed for
  
   Debian
  
  version 4.0 (etch, which was released in 2007).
  

    [159]
   

  This distribution contained close to 283 million source lines of code, and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand man-years and cost US$8.28 billion (in 2017 dollars) to develop by conventional means.
 



  In the United States, the name
  
   Linux
  
  is a trademark registered to Linus Torvalds.
  

    [8]
   

  Initially, nobody registered it, but on August 15, 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. filed for the trademark
  
   Linux
  
  , and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was settled.
  

    [161]
   

  The licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the
  
   Linux Mark Institute
  
  (LMI). Torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it. LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the Linux name as part of trademarks,
  

    [162]
   

  but later changed this in favor of offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.
  

    [163]
   


  The
  
   Free Software Foundation
  
  (FSF) prefers
  
   GNU/Linux
  
  as the name when referring to the operating system as a whole, because it considers Linux distributions to be
  
   variants
  
  of the
  
   GNU
  
  operating system initiated in 1983 by
  
   Richard Stallman
  
  , president of the FSF.
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   

  They explicitly take no issue over the name Android for the Android OS, which is also an operating system based on the Linux kernel, as GNU is not a part of it. However, they object to it on grounds of including proprietary components. The FSF holds this stance for any operating system with proprietary components, including Linux operating systems such as
  
   Red Hat Linux
  
  .
  
   [

  A minority of public figures and software projects other than Stallman and the FSF, notably
  
   Debian
  
  (which had been sponsored by the FSF up to 1996),
  

    [164]
   

  also use
  
   GNU/Linux
  
  when referring to the operating system as a whole.
  

    [114]
   



    [165]
   



    [166]
   

  Most media and common usage, however, refers to this family of operating systems simply as
  
   Linux
  
  , as do many large Linux distributions (for example,
  
   SUSE Linux
  
  and
  
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  
  ). In contrast Linux distributions containing only free software use "GNU/Linux" or simply "GNU", such as
  
   Trisquel GNU/Linux
  
  ,
  
   Parabola GNU/Linux-libre
  
  ,
  
   BLAG Linux and GNU
  
  , and
  
   gNewSense
  
  .
 
  As of May 2011
  

    [update]
   

  , about 8% to 13% of a modern Linux distribution is made of GNU components (the range depending on whether
  
   GNOME
  
  is considered part of GNU), as determined by counting
  
   lines of source code
  
  making up Ubuntu's "Natty" release; meanwhile, 6% is taken by the Linux kernel, and 9% by the Linux kernel and its direct dependencies.
