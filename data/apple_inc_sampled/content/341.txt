  The
  
   Apple M7
  
  (codename Oscar),
  
   M8
  
  ,
  
   M9, and M10
  
  are motion
  
   coprocessors
  
  used by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  in their mobile devices. Their function is to collect sensor data from integrated
  
   accelerometers
  
  ,
  
   gyroscopes
  
  and
  
   compasses
  
  and offload the collecting and processing of sensor data from the main
  
   central processing unit
  
  (CPU). The M7 was introduced in September 2013 with the
  
   iPhone 5S

  and the updated version, M8 was introduced in September 2014 with the
  
   iPhone 6
  
  and also processes data from the
  
   barometer
  
  that is included in the
  
   iPhone 6
  
  and
  
   iPad Air 2
  
  .

  September 2015 brought the M9 motion coprocessor embedded within the
  
   A9
  
  chip found in the
  
   iPhone 6S
  
  ,
  
   iPhone 6S Plus
  
  ,
  
   iPhone SE
  


    [8]
   

  and within the
  
   A9X
  
  chip found in the
  
   iPad Pro
  
  .

  Apple announced the latest addition to its motion coprocessors, the M10, September 2016, found in the
  
   iPhone 7
  
  and
  
   iPhone 7 Plus
  
  .
  

    [11]
   


  Chipworks found that the M7 most likely is a
  
   NXP
  

   LPC1800
  
  based
  
   microcontroller
  
  called
  
   LPC18A1
  
  . It uses an
  
   ARM Cortex-M3
  
  core with a customised packaging and naming scheme indicating that it is for an Apple customized part.
  

    [1]
   


   iFixit
  
  have identified the M8 in the iPhone 6 to be an NXP device with a very similar name, the
  
   LPC18B1
  
  .

  The Apple
  
   M7
  
  , M8, M9, and M10 coprocessors collect, process, and store sensor data even if the device is asleep, and applications can retrieve data when the device is powered up again. This reduces power draw of the device and saves battery life.
  

    [13]
   

  In addition to servicing the
  
   accelerometer
  
  ,
  
   gyroscope
  
  ,
  
   compass
  
  , and
  
   barometer
  
  , the M9 coprocessor can recognize
  
   Siri
  
  voice commands from the built in
  
   microphones
  
  of the device.

  The M-series motion coprocessors are accessible to applications through the
  
   Core Motion
  

   API
  
  introduced in
  
   iOS 7
  
  , so they do, for example, allow fitness apps that track physical activity and access data from the M processors without constantly engaging the main application processor. They enable applications to be aware of what type of movement the user is experiencing, such as driving, walking, running, or sleeping.

  Another application could be the ability to do indoor tracking and mapping.

  In
  
   iOS 10
  
  , the motion coprocessor is used for raise to wake functionality.
