   NeXTSTEP
  
  is a discontinued
  
   object-oriented
  
  ,
  
   multitasking
  

   operating system
  
  based on
  
   UNIX
  
  . It was developed by
  
   NeXT Computer
  
  in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was initially used for its range of proprietary
  
   workstation
  
  computers such as the
  
   NeXTcube
  
  and later ported to several other
  
   computer architectures
  
  . Although relatively unsuccessful at the time, it attracted interest from computer scientists and researchers. It was used as the original platform for the development of the
  
   Electronic AppWrapper
  
  ,
  

    [1]
   

  the first commercial electronic software distribution catalog to collectively manage encryption and provide digital rights for
  
   application software
  
  and
  
   digital media
  
  , a forerunner of the modern 'App Store' concept. It was also the platform on which
  
   Tim Berners-Lee
  
  created the first
  
   web browser
  
  . After the purchase of NeXT by
  
   Apple
  
  , it became the source of the popular operating systems
  
   macOS
  
  ,
  
   iOS
  
  ,
  
   watchOS
  
  and
  
   tvOS
  
  . Many bundled macOS applications, such as
  
   TextEdit
  
  ,
  
   Mail
  
  and
  
   Chess
  
  , are descendants of NeXTSTEP applications.
 


  NeXTSTEP (also stylized as
  
   NeXTstep
  
  ,
  
   NeXTStep
  
  , and
  
   NEXTSTEP
  


    [2]
   

  ) is a combination of several parts:
 
  NeXTSTEP is notable for having been a preeminent implementation of the latter three items. The toolkits offer considerable power, and are the canonical development system for all of the software on the machine.
 
  NeXTSTEP's user interface is considered to be refined and consistent.

  It introduced the idea of the
  
   Dock
  
  (carried through
  
   OpenStep
  
  and into today's
  
   macOS
  
  ) and the
  
   Shelf
  
  . NeXTSTEP also originated or innovated a large number of other
  
   GUI
  
  concepts which became common in other operating systems: 3D "chiseled" widgets, large full-color
  
   icons
  
  , system-wide drag and drop of a wide range of objects beyond file icons, system-wide piped
  
   services
  
  , real-time scrolling and window dragging, properties dialog boxes called "inspectors", and window modification notices (such as the saved status of a file). The system is among the first general-purpose user interfaces to handle publishing color standards, transparency, sophisticated sound and music processing (through a
  
   Motorola 56000
  

   DSP
  
  ), advanced
  
   graphics primitives
  
  , internationalization, and modern
  
   typography
  
  , in a consistent manner across all applications.
 
  Additional kits were added to the product line to make the system more attractive. These include Portable Distributed Objects (PDO), which allow easy
  
   remote invocation
  
  , and
  
   Enterprise Objects Framework
  
  , a powerful
  
   object-relational
  

   database
  
  system. The kits made the system particularly interesting to custom application programmers, and NeXTSTEP had a long history in the financial programming community.

  A preview release of NeXTSTEP (version 0.8) was shown with the launch of the
  
   NeXT Computer
  
  on October 12, 1988. The first full release, NeXTSTEP 1.0, shipped on September 18, 1989.
  

    [3]
   

  The last version, 3.3, was released in early 1995, by which time it ran on not only the
  
   Motorola
  

   68000 family
  
  processors used in NeXT computers, but also on
  
   Intel
  

   x86
  
  ,
  
   Sun
  

   SPARC
  
  , and
  
   HP PA-RISC
  
  -based systems.
 
  NeXTSTEP was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries. The result was the
  
   OpenStep
  
  API, which ran on multiple underlying operating systems, including NeXT's own OPENSTEP,
  
   Windows NT
  


    [4]
   

  and
  
   SUN Solaris
  
  . NeXTSTEP's legacy stands today in the form of its direct descendents, Apple's
  
   macOS
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  operating systems.
 
  From day one, the operating system of NeXTSTEP was built upon Mach/BSD.
 
  The first
  
   web browser
  
  ,
  
   WorldWideWeb
  
  , and the first ever
  
   app store
  
  were all invented on the NeXTSTEP platform.

  Some features and
  
   keyboard shortcuts
  
  now commonly found in web browsers can be traced back to NeXTSTEP conventions. The basic layout options of
  
   HTML
  
  1.0 and 2.0 are attributable to those features available in NeXT's Text class.

  Features seen first on NeXTSTEP:
 
  In the 1990s, the pioneering PC games
  

    Wolfenstein 3D
   

  ,
  

    Doom
   

  (with its
  
   WAD
  
  level editor),
  

    Doom II
   

  , and
  

    Quake
   

  (with its respective level editor) were
  
   developed
  
  by
  
   id Software
  
  on NeXT machines. Other games based on the
  

    Doom
   
   engine
  
  such as
  

    Heretic
   

  and its sequel
  

    Hexen
   

  by
  
   Raven Software
  
  as well as
  

    Strife
   

  by
  
   Rogue Entertainment
  
  were also developed on NeXT hardware using id's tools.

   Altsys
  
  made a NeXTSTEP application called Virtuoso, version 2 of which was ported to Mac OS and Windows to become
  
   Macromedia FreeHand
  
  version 4. The modern "Notebook" interface for
  
   Mathematica
  
  , and the advanced spreadsheet
  
   Lotus Improv
  
  , were developed using NeXTSTEP. The software that controlled
  
   MCI
  
  's Friends and Family calling plan program was developed using NeXTSTEP.

  About the time of the release of NeXTSTEP 3.2, NeXT partnered with
  
   Sun Microsystems
  
  to develop
  
   OpenStep
  
  . It is the product of an effort to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries to create a cross-platform object-oriented API standard derived from NeXTSTEP. The
  
   OpenStep
  
  API targets multiple underlying operating systems, including NeXT's own OPENSTEP. Implementations of that standard were released for Sun's
  
   Solaris
  
  ,
  
   Windows NT
  
  , and NeXT's version of the
  
   Mach kernel
  
  . NeXT's implementation is called "OPENSTEP for Mach" and its first release (4.0) superseded NeXTSTEP 3.3 on NeXT, Sun and Intel
  
   IA-32
  
  systems.
 
  Following an announcement on December 20, 1996,
  

    [10]
   


   Apple Computer
  
  acquired NeXT on February 4, 1997 for $429 million. Based upon the "
  
   OPENSTEP
  
  for Mach" operating system, and developing the OPENSTEP API to become
  
   Cocoa
  
  , Apple created the basis of
  
   Mac OS X
  
  ,
  

    [11]
   

  and eventually, in turn, of
  
   iOS
  
  .
 
  A
  
   free software
  
  implementation of the OpenStep standard,
  
   GNUstep
  
  , also exists.

      NeXTSTEP 2.0 Release Notes (User)
     

     Delivered on 2 CDs: NeXTSTEP
     
      CISC
     
     and NeXTSTEP
     
      RISC
     
     . The Developer CD includes libraries for all
     
      architectures
     
     , so that programs can be
     
      cross-compiled
     
     on any architecture for all architectures
    
     Notable as being a precursor of many ideas later introduced in the
     
      macOS Dock
     
     .
    
     Allegedly dropped due to complaints of having to re-teach users but not for technical reasons (the new UI worked well in the beta)
    
  Versions up to 4.1 are general releases. OPENSTEP 4.2 pre-release 2 is a bug-fix release published by Apple and was supported for five years after its September 1997 release.
