   Windows 10 Mobile
  
  is a
  
   mobile operating system
  
  developed by
  
   Microsoft
  
  . It is an iteration of the
  
   Windows Phone
  
  product line and a successor to
  
   Windows Phone 8.1
  
  ,
  

    [7]
   

  and is an
  
   edition of Windows 10
  
  , Microsoft's operating system for
  
   personal computers
  
  , as part of Microsoft's plans to unify Windows' application platform across multiple device classes.
  

    [8]
   


  Windows 10 Mobile aims to provide greater consistency with its counterpart for personal computers, including more extensive synchronization of content, a new universal application platform that allows one app to run on multiple Windows 10 devices such as
  
   PCs
  
  ,
  
   mobile devices
  
  and
  
   Xbox
  
  , as well as the capability, on supported hardware, to connect devices to an external display and use a "PC-like" interface with mouse and keyboard input support. Microsoft has built tools for
  
   developers
  
  to easily
  
   port
  
  some
  
   iOS
  
  apps with minimal modifications. Windows Phone 8.1 smartphones are eligible for upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support.
  

    [9]
   

  Some features may vary depending on hardware compatibility.
  

    [10]
   


  Windows 10 Mobile is designed for use on
  
   smartphones
  
  and
  
   phablets
  
  running on
  
   ARM
  
  processor architectures.
  

    [5]
   

  Windows 10 Mobile entered public beta for selected
  
   Lumia brand
  
  smartphones on February 12, 2015.
  

    [11]
   

  The first Lumia smartphones powered by Windows 10 Mobile were released on November 20, 2015 while eligible Windows Phone devices began receiving updates to Windows 10 Mobile on March 17, 2016, pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support.
 


  Microsoft had already begun the process of unifying the Windows platform across device classes in 2012;
  
   Windows Phone 8
  
  dropped the
  
   Windows CE
  
  -based architecture of its predecessor,
  
   Windows Phone 7
  
  ,
  

    [12]
   

  for a platform built upon the
  
   NT kernel
  
  that shared much of the same architecture with its PC counterpart
  
   Windows 8
  
  including file system (
  
   NTFS
  
  ), networking stack, security elements, graphics engine (
  
   DirectX
  
  ), device driver framework and
  
   hardware abstraction layer
  
  .
  

    [13]
   



    [14]
   

  At
  
   Build 2014
  
  , Microsoft also unveiled the concept of
  
   "universal" Windows apps
  
  . With the addition of
  
   Windows Runtime
  
  support to these platforms, apps created for
  
   Windows 8.1
  
  could now be
  
   ported
  
  to
  
   Windows Phone 8.1
  
  and
  
   Xbox One
  
  while sharing a common codebase with their PC counterparts. User data and
  
   licenses
  
  for an app could also be shared between multiple platforms.
  

    [15]
   


  In July 2014, Microsoft's then-new CEO
  
   Satya Nadella
  
  explained that the company was planning to "streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for screens of all sizes," unifying Windows,
  
   Windows Phone
  
  , and
  
   Windows Embedded
  
  around a common architecture and a unified application ecosystem. However, Nadella stated that these internal changes would not have any effect on how the operating systems are
  
   marketed and sold
  
  .
  

    [16]
   



    [17]
   


  On September 30, 2014, Microsoft unveiled
  
   Windows 10
  
  ;
  
   Terry Myerson
  
  explained that Windows 10 would be Microsoft's "most comprehensive platform ever," promoting plans to provide a "unified" platform for
  
   desktop computers
  
  ,
  
   laptops
  
  ,
  
   tablets
  
  ,
  
   smartphones
  
  , and
  
   all-in-one
  
  devices.
  

    [18]
   



    [19]
   

  Windows 10 on phones was publicly unveiled during the
  
   Windows 10: The Next Chapter
  
  press event on January 21, 2015; unlike previous Windows Phone versions, it would also expand the platform's focus to small, ARM-based tablets. Microsoft's previous attempt at an operating system for ARM-based tablets,
  
   Windows RT
  
  (which was based upon the PC version of Windows 8) was commercially unsuccessful.
  

    [20]
   


  During the
  
   2015 Build
  
  keynote, Microsoft announced the
  
   middleware
  
  toolkit "Islandwood", later known as Windows Bridge for iOS, which provides a
  
   toolchain
  
  that can assist developers in porting
  
   Objective-C
  
  software (primarily
  
   iOS
  
  projects) to build as Universal Windows Apps.
  

    [21]
   



    [22]
   

  An early build of Windows Bridge for iOS was released as open source software under the
  
   MIT License
  
  on August 6, 2015.
  

    [22]
   



    [23]
   


   Visual Studio 2015
  
  can also convert
  
   Xcode
  
  projects into Visual Studio projects.
  

    [22]
   



    [24]
   



    [25]
   

  Microsoft also announced plans for a toolkit codenamed "Centennial",
  

    [26]
   

  which would allow desktop Windows software using
  
   Win32
  
  APIs to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile.
  

    [27]
   


  At Build, Microsoft had also announced an
  
   Android
  
  runtime environment for Windows 10 Mobile known as "Astoria", which would allow Android apps to run in an emulated environment with minimal changes, and have access to Microsoft platform APIs such as
  
   Bing Maps
  
  and
  
   Xbox Live
  
  as nearly drop-in replacements for equivalent
  
   Google Mobile Services
  
  . Google Mobile Services and certain core APIs would not be available, and apps with "deep integration into background tasks" were said to poorly support the environment.
  

    [28]
   



    [29]
   


  On February 25, 2016, after already having delayed it in November 2015,
  

    [27]
   



    [30]
   

  Microsoft announced that "Astoria" would be shelved. Microsoft argued that an Android emulator was ultimately redundant to the native, Objective-C toolchain, because iOS was already a primary target in multi-platform mobile development. The company also encouraged use of products from
  
   Xamarin
  
  (which they had acquired the previous day) for multi-platform app development using
  
   C#
  
  programming language instead.
  

    [26]
   



    [31]
   

  The
  
   Windows Subsystem for Linux
  
  was developed from Project Astoria.
  

    [32]
   


  In accordance with Microsoft's branding strategy, this operating system will be branded primarily as an edition of Windows 10, rather than "Windows Phone 10". Microsoft had begun to phase out specific references to the Windows Phone brand in its advertising in mid-2014, but critics have still considered the operating system to be an iteration and continuation of Windows Phone due to its lineage and similar overall functionality. Microsoft referred to the OS as "Windows 10 for phones and small tablets" during its unveiling,
  

    [33]
   

  leaked screenshots from a Technical Preview build identified the operating system as "Windows 10 Mobile"
  

    [34]
   



    [35]
   



    [36]
   



    [37]
   

  and the technical preview was officially called the "Windows 10 Technical Preview for phones".
  

    [38]
   

  Internally, the
  
   Microsoft Edge
  

   user agent
  
  on Windows 10 Mobile still contains a reference to "Windows Phone 10".
  

    [39]
   


  On May 13, 2015, Microsoft officially confirmed the platform would be known as Windows 10 Mobile.
  

    [7]
   



    [40]
   


  A major aspect of Windows 10 Mobile is a focus on harmonizing user experiences and functionality between different classes of devices—specifically, devices running the PC-oriented version of Windows 10. Under the
  
   Universal Windows Platform
  
  concept,
  
   Windows Runtime
  
  apps for Windows 10 on PC can be
  
   ported
  
  to other platforms in the Windows 10 family with nearly the same codebase, but with adaptations for specific device classes. Windows 10 Mobile also shares user interface elements with its PC counterpart, such as the updated Action Center and settings menu.
  

    [15]
   



    [20]
   



    [33]
   



    [34]
   



    [41]
   

  During its initial unveiling, Microsoft presented several examples of Windows apps that would have similar functionality and user interfaces between Windows 10 on desktops and mobile devices, including updated Photos and Maps apps, and new
  
   Microsoft Office apps
  
  .
  

    [42]
   



    [43]
   



    [44]
   

  Although marketed as a converged platform, and as with
  
   Windows Phone 8
  
  , using a
  
   Windows NT
  
  -based kernel, Windows 10 Mobile still cannot run
  
   Win32
  
  desktop applications, but is compatible with software designed for Windows Phone 8.
  

    [45]
   


  Notifications can be synced between devices; dismissing a notification on, for example, a laptop, will also dismiss it from a phone. Certain types of notifications now allow inline replies. The start screen now has the option to display wallpapers as a background of the screen behind translucent tiles, rather than within the tiles.
  

    [46]
   

  The messaging app adds support for internet-based
  
   Skype
  
  messaging alongside
  
   SMS
  
  , similarly to
  
   iMessage
  
  , and can synchronize these conversations with other devices.
  

    [35]
   



    [47]
   

  The camera app has been updated to match the "Lumia Camera" app previously exclusive to
  
   Lumia
  
  products,
  

    [47]
   

  and a new Photos app aggregates content from local storage and
  
   OneDrive
  
  , and can perform automatic enhancements to photos.
  

    [47]
   

  The on-screen keyboard now contains a virtual pointing stick for manipulating the text editing cursor, a dedicated voice input button, and can be shifted towards the left or right of the screen to improve one-handed usability on larger devices.
  

    [34]
   



    [47]
   



    [48]
   


  Windows 10 Mobile supports "Continuum", a feature that allows supported devices to connect to an external display, and scale its user interface and apps into a "PC-like" desktop interface with support for mouse and keyboard input over USB or Bluetooth.
  

    [49]
   



    [50]
   

  Devices can connect directly to external displays wirelessly using
  
   Miracast
  
  ,
  

    [51]
   

  via
  
   USB Type-C
  
  , or via
  
   docking station
  
  accessories with USB ports, as well as
  
   HDMI
  
  and
  
   DisplayPort
  
  outputs.
  

    [52]
   


  A new iteration of the
  
   Office Mobile
  
  suite, Office for Windows 10, is also bundled. Based upon the
  
   Android
  
  and
  
   iOS
  
  versions of Office Mobile, they introduce a new user interface with a variation of the
  
   ribbon toolbar
  
  used by the desktop version, and a new mobile version of
  
   Outlook
  
  . Outlook utilizes the same rendering engine as the Windows desktop version of
  
   Microsoft Word
  
  .
  

    [41]
   



    [42]
   



    [53]
   


   Microsoft Edge
  
  replaces
  
   Internet Explorer Mobile
  
  as the default web browser.
  

    [54]
   


  Windows 10 Mobile's first-party launch devices—the
  
   Lumia 950
  
  ,
  
   Lumia 950 XL
  
  , and
  
   Lumia 550
  
  —were released in November 2015 being the first phones to ship with Windows 10 Mobile.
  

    [55]
   



    [56]
   

  Monthly updates to the OS software are being released to address bugs and security issues. These updates are distributed to all Windows 10 Mobile devices and do not require the intervention of a user's wireless carrier in order to authorize their distribution. Firmware upgrades will still require authorization by the user's carrier.
  

    [57]
   


  The
  
   Windows Insider
  
  program, adopted to provide a public beta for the PC version of Windows 10,
  

    [58]
   

  is used to provide a public beta version of Windows 10 Mobile for selected devices.
  

    [59]
   

  A build released on April 10, 2015 was to support most second and third generation Lumia products, but the
  
   Lumia 930
  
  ,
  
   Lumia Icon
  
  , and
  
   Lumia 640 XL
  
  did not receive the update due to scaling bugs, and delivery was suspended as a whole due to backup and restore issues on some models.
  

    [60]
   



    [61]
   

  An update to the
  
   Windows Phone Recovery Tool
  
  resolved these concerns,
  

    [62]
   

  and delivery of Windows 10 updates was restored to the 520 with build 10052, and to the 640 with build 10080.
  
   [

  Build number 10136 was released on June 16, 2015, with a "migration bug" that required that existing devices on build 10080 be reverted to Windows Phone 8.1 using the Recovery Tool before the installation of 10136 could proceed.
  

    [63]
   

  This migration bug was fixed a week later with the release of build 10149.
  

    [64]
   

  Mobile builds of the Redstone branch till 14322 were halted for the device
  
   Lumia 635
  
  (1 GB RAM) due to bugs.
  

    [4]
   


  Some Windows Phone 8.1 smartphones can be upgraded to Windows 10, pursuant to hardware compatibility, manufacturer support, and carrier support. Not all phones can receive the update nor support all of its features.
  

    [9]
   



    [59]
   

  Microsoft originally stated that stable upgrades for Windows Phone 8.1 devices would be released in December 2015; however, the release was ultimately delayed to March 17, 2016.
  

    [65]
   



    [66]
   

  Among first-party devices, only the
  
   Lumia 430
  
  ,
  
   435
  
  ,
  
   532
  
  ,
  
   535
  
  ,
  
   540
  
  , 635 (1 GB RAM),
  
   640
  
  ,
  
   640 XL
  
  ,
  
   735
  
  ,
  
   830
  
  ,
  
   929
  
  ,
  
   930
  
  and
  
   1520
  
  are supported. The only third-party devices supported are the
  
   BLU Products
  
  Win HD w510u and Win HD LTE x150q, and the MCJ Madosma Q501. Windows 10 Mobile does not officially support any
  
   HTC
  
  devices (
  
   HTC One M8 for Windows
  
  ,
  
   HTC Windows Phone 8X
  
  ,
  
   HTC Windows Phone 8S
  
  ), although the HTC One M8 for Windows could be upgraded to the public release version of Windows 10 Mobile through the
  
   Windows Insider
  
  program. While Microsoft stated that the
  
   Nokia Lumia Icon
  
  may be upgraded at a later date, the company stated that there will not be a second wave of officially-supported devices. Microsoft also removed statements which promoted the BLU Win JR LTE as being compatible with Windows 10.
  

    [67]
   



    [68]
   



    [69]
   


  Microsoft originally stated that all
  
   Lumia
  
  smartphones running Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 would receive updates to 10, but Microsoft later reiterated that only devices with the "Lumia Denim" firmware revision and at least 8 GB of internal storage would receive the upgrade.
  

    [48]
   



    [56]
   

  In February 2015,
  
   Joe Belfiore
  
  stated that Microsoft was working on support for devices with 512 MB of RAM, (such as the popular
  
   Nokia Lumia 520
  
  ),
  

    [59]
   

  but these plans have since been dropped.
  

    [70]
   

  Upon the official upgrade release, some Lumia models, particularly the
  
   Lumia 1020
  
  and
  
   1320
  
  , were excluded despite meeting the previously announced criteria. Microsoft cited poor user feedback on the performance of preview builds on these models as reasoning.
  

    [71]
   


  Reception of Windows 10 Mobile has been mixed. The Verge was disappointed with the direction that Windows 10 Mobile has taken, describing it as feeling "buggy and unfinished".
  

    [72]
   

  Tech Radar praised the OS for its design, but noted that the lack of apps was the "biggest let-down on Windows Phone and Windows 10 Mobile alike."
  

    [73]
   


  Windows 10 Mobile has also been criticized for its poorer performance than Windows Phone 8.1 on some devices. After many user complaints, Microsoft started allowing users to downgrade from Windows 10 to Windows Phone 8.1.
  

    [74]
   


  Sales have decreased rapidly since its release,
  

    [75]
   

  to the point of Windows 10 Mobile being considered irrelevant in the mobile operating system landscape.
  

    [76]
   


  As with Windows Phone, Windows 10 Mobile supports
  
   ARM
  

   system-on-chips
  
  from
  
   Qualcomm
  
  's
  
   Snapdragon
  
  line. In March 2015,
  

    Ars Technica
   

  reported that the operating system will also introduce support for
  
   IA-32
  
  system-on-chips from
  
   Intel
  
  and
  
   AMD
  
  , including Intel's Atom x3 and
  
   Cherry Trail
  
  Atom x5 and x7, and AMD's
  
   Carrizo
  
  .
  

    [77]
   

  However, as of November 2016, it did not happen.
  

    [5]
   



    [78]
   


  Minimum specifications for Windows 10 Mobile devices are similar to those of Windows Phone 8, with a minimum screen resolution of 800×480 (854×480 if software buttons are in use), 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage.
  

    [5]
   

  Owing to hardware advancements and the operating system's support for tablets, screen resolutions can now reach as high as
  
   QSXGA
  
  resolution (2560×2048) and further, as opposed to the
  
   1080p
  
  cap of Windows Phone 8. The minimum amount of RAM required is dictated by the screen's resolution; screens with a resolution 800×480 or 960×540 and higher require 1 GB, 1920×1080 (
  
   FHD
  
  ) or 1440×900 and higher require 2 GB, and 2560×1440 and higher require 3 GB.

  Microsoft unveiled flagship
  
   Microsoft Lumia
  
  smartphones during a media event on October 6, 2015, including
  
   Lumia 950
  
  ,
  
   Lumia 950 XL
  
  , and the low-end
  
   Lumia 550
  
  .
  

    [55]
   


  Microsoft announced Windows 10 Mobile during their January 21, 2015 event "The Next Chapter". The first Windows 10 Mobile build was rolled out on February 12, 2015 as part of the
  
   Windows Insider
  
  Program to a subset of
  
   mobile devices running Windows Phone 8
  
  and
  
   8.1
  
  . As with the desktop editions of Windows 10, this initial release was codenamed "Threshold", it was part of both the "Threshold 1" and "Threshold 2" development cycles.
  

    [79]
   



    [80]
   

  Windows 10 Mobile launched with the
  
   Microsoft Lumia 550
  
  ,
  
   950
  
  and
  
   950 XL
  
  . The rollout for
  
   Windows Phone 8.1
  
  devices started March 17, 2016.
  

    [81]
   


  On February 19, 2016, Microsoft restarted the rollout of full builds for the first feature update, officially known as the "Anniversary Update" or "Version 1607",
  

    [82]
   

  codenamed
  
   "
  
  Redstone 1
  
   "
  
  . Like the start of the previous wave, the first builds were not available to all devices that were included in the Windows Insider Program.
  

    [83]
   



    [84]
   


  Codename "Redstone 2" is the second major update to Windows 10 Mobile. The first preview flighted out to Insiders on August 17, 2016.
  

    [85]
