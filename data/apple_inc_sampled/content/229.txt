   Netflix
  
  is an American
  
   entertainment
  
  company founded by
  
   Reed Hastings
  
  and
  
   Marc Randolph
  
  on August 29, 1997, in
  
   Scotts Valley, California
  
  .
  

    [7]
   

  It specializes in and
  
   provides
  

   streaming media
  
  and
  
   video-on-demand
  
  online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into
  
   film
  
  and
  
   television production
  
  , as well as online
  
   distribution
  
  . As of 2017
  

    [update]
   

  the company has its headquarters in
  
   Los Gatos, California
  
  .
 
  Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the
  
   DVD rental by mail
  
  business.

    [8]
   

  In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and
  
   Blu-ray
  
  rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010
  

    [9]
   

  and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.
  

    [10]
   


  Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series,
  

    House of Cards
   

  . It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "
  
   Netflix Original
  
  " content through its online library of films and television.
  

    [11]
   

  Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.
  

    [12]
   


  In January 2017, Netflix reported having over 93 million subscribers worldwide, including more than 49 million in the United States.

  Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in
  
   Scotts Valley, California
  
  , by
  
   Marc Randolph
  


    [13]
   



    [14]
   

  and
  
   Reed Hastings
  
  . Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company,
  
   Pure Atria Corporation
  
  . Randolph was a co-founder of
  
   MicroWarehouse
  
  , a computer mail order company, and was later employed by
  
   Borland International
  
  as
  
   vice president
  
  of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.
  

    [15]
   


  Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.
  

    [16]
   



    [8]
   

  Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.
  

    [15]
   

  Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a video store for being late to return a copy of
  
   Apollo 13
  
  but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.
  

    [15]
   


  Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,
  

    [15]
   

  with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.
  

    [17]
   



    [15]
   


  Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,
  

    [18]
   

  and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.
 
  In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by
  
   Blockbuster
  
  for $50 million, but the offer was declined.
  

    [19]
   

  Netflix initiated an
  
   initial public offering
  
  (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of
  
   common stock
  
  at the price of
  
   US$
  
  15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.
  

    [20]
   


  Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.
  

    [21]
   


  Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a
  
   $1,000,000 prize
  
  to the first developer of a video-recommendation
  
   algorithm
  
  that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.
  

    [22]
   


  In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,
  

    [23]
   

  and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing
  
   video on demand
  
  via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.
  

    [24]
   



    [25]
   


  In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.
  

    [26]
   



    [27]
   

  That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.
  

    [28]
   

  As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).
  

    [29]
   

  By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.
  

    [30]
   

  By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.
  

    [31]
   


  Netflix has played a prominent role in
  
   independent film
  
  distribution. Through its division
  
   Red Envelope Entertainment
  
  , Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as
  

    Born into Brothels
   

  and
  

    Sherrybaby
   

  . As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as
  
   John Waters
  
  .
  

    [32]
   

  Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.
  

    [33]
   



    [34]
   


  Netflix has been one of the most successful
  
   dot-com ventures
  
  . In September 2002,
  

    The New York Times
   

  reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.
  

    [35]
   

  The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of
  
   DVD players
  
  in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.
  

    [36]
   


  By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the
  
   United States Postal Service
  
  's
  
   first-class service
  
  to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.
  

    [37]
   

  On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent
  
   subsidiary
  
  called
  
   Qwikster
  
  , separating DVD rental and streaming services.
  

    [38]
   



    [39]
   



    [40]
   

  Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry
  
   video games
  
  whereas Netflix did not.
  

    [41]
   

  However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.
  

    [42]
   


  In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.
  

    [43]
   

  But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.
  

    [44]
   



    [45]
   

  Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.
  

    [46]
   

  On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.
  

    [47]
   

  On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.
  

    [48]
   


  In April 2012, Netflix filed with the
  
   Federal Election Commission
  
  (FEC) to form a
  
   political action committee
  
  (PAC) called FLIXPAC.
  

    [49]
   



    Politico
   

  referred to the PAC, based in
  
   Los Gatos, California
  
  , as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."
  

    [49]
   

  The hacktivist group
  
   Anonymous
  
  called for a
  
   boycott
  
  of Netflix following the news.
  

    [50]
   

  Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the
  
   Stop Online Piracy Act
  
  (SOPA) and the
  
   PROTECT IP Act
  
  (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like
  
   net neutrality
  
  ,
  
   bandwidth caps
  
  ,
  
   UBB
  
  and
  
   VPPA
  
  ."
  

    [51]
   



    [52]
   


  In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony,
  
   The Flixies
  
  .
  

    [53]
   

  On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a
  
   Facebook
  
  implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.
  

    [54]
   

  This was not legal until the
  
   Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988
  
  was modified in early 2013.
  

    [55]
   


  In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.
  

    [56]
   

  In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the
  
   drop shadowing
  
  removed, and a new website
  
   UI
  
  . The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.
  

    [57]
   

  In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.
  

    [58]
   


  At the 2016
  
   CES
  
  Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"
  

    [59]
   

  A notable absence was
  
   China
  
  which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.
  

    [59]
   

  By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.
  

    [60]
   


  Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking
  
   virtual private networks
  
  , or VPNs.
  

    [61]
   

  At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.
  

    [62]
   

  By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.
  

    [63]
   


  In February 2017, Netflix signed a
  
   music publishing
  
  deal with
  
   BMG Rights Management
  
  , where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.
  

    [64]
   


  Netflix's
  
   video on demand
  
  streaming service, formerly branded as
  
   Watch Now
  
  , allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on
  
   personal computers
  
  , or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including
  
   smartphones
  
  and
  
   tablets
  
  ,
  
   digital media players
  
  ,
  
   video game consoles
  
  , and
  
   smart TVs
  


    [65]
   

  According to a
  
   Nielsen
  
  survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the
  
   Wii
  
  , 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a
  
   PlayStation 3
  
  and 12% an
  
   Xbox 360
  
  .
  

    [66]
   


  When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of
  
   Hulu
  
  and to
  
   Apple
  
  's new video-rental services.
  

    [67]
   

  Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.
  

    [68]
   


  Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers
  
   standard definition
  
  streaming on a single device, the second allows
  
   high definition
  
  streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and
  
   4K
  
  streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.
  

    [69]
   



    [70]
   



    [71]
   


  Until October 10, 2014, Netflix did not officially support
  
   Linux
  
  devices, though a
  
   Roku
  
  is supported, being able to connect it from a
  
   console
  
  or
  
   Blu-ray
  
  player to a Linux PC or monitor with an adapter. It is possible to run
  
   Windows
  
  and Netflix in a virtual machines like the
  
   Virtualbox
  
  or
  
   QEMU
  
  . In a
  

    TechRepublic
   

  interview in August 2010, Netflix's VP of Corporate Communications stated that
  
   Silverlight
  
  plugins for Linux, being
  
   Moonlight
  
  , do not support the
  
   PlayReady
  

   DRM
  
  system that Netflix requires for playback.
  

    [72]
   

  Netflix does support
  
   Android
  
  , which uses a
  
   forked
  
  version of the
  
   kernel
  
  . There is an unofficial Netflix app based on
  
   Wine
  
  that allows users to watch Netflix's content on Linux effortlessly.
  
   Pipelight
  
  , an add-on for
  
   Firefox
  
  based on the Netflix-Desktop project, allows playback through Linux Native web browsers by connecting to the Wine-based Silverlight plugin.

  However, on October 10, 2014, the required DRM plugins became available for Chrome users running
  
   Ubuntu
  
  12.04 or 14.04.
  

    [74]
   

  Maximum HD resolution via Google Chrome is 720p.
  

    [75]
   


  On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.
  

    [76]
   



    [77]
   



    [78]
   


  On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with
  
   Starz
  
  to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.
  

    [79]
   


  In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from
  
   Paramount
  
  ,
  
   Lionsgate
  
  and
  
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
  
  . The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.
  

    [80]
   


  On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.
  

    [81]
   

  The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.
  

    [82]
   


   Twitter
  
  comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.
  

    [82]
   

  The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:
 
   "Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."
   

     [81]
    


  In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.
  

    [83]
   


  In the United States, the company provides a monthly
  
   flat-fee
  
  for DVD and
  
   Blu-ray
  
  rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the
  
   United States Postal Service
  
  from regional
  
   warehouses
  
  . As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States
  

    [84]
   

  The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a
  
   metered reply mail
  
  envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
 
  Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight
  
   [

   ]
  
  DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on
  
   Blu-Ray disc
  
  for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.
  

    [85]
   


  On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with
  
   Warner Bros.
  
  to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving
  
   Universal
  
  and
  
   20th Century Fox
  
  were reached on April 9.
  

    [86]
   



    [87]
   



    [88]
   

  In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
 
  On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as
  
   Qwikster
  
  . CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.

    [90]
   



    [91]
   



    [92]
   


  On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.
  

    [91]
   



    [92]
   



    [93]
   


  In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to
  

    TechCrunch
   

  that it had acquired the
  
   domain name
  
  DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name
  
   DVD.com, A Netflix Company
  
  .
  

    [94]
   



    [95]
   



    [96]
   


  In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.
  

    [97]
   

  Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.
  

    [98]
   

  However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,
  

    [99]
   



    [100]
   



    [101]
   

  Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.

  In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."
  

    [103]
   


  Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".
  

    [104]
   

  Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at
  
   Gartner
  
  , said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".
  

    [104]
   

  Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual
  
   Facebook
  
  accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,
  

    [104]
   



    [105]
   

  since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.
  

    [105]
   

  Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told
  
   CNNMoney
  
  : "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said
  
   focus-group
  
  testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".
  

    [106]
   


  Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.
  

    [107]
   


  Critics of the feature have noted:
 
  In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.

  In 2011, Netflix introduced a
  
   Netflix button
  
  for certain
  
   remote controls
  
  , allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.
  

    [109]
   


  Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World
  
   Maker Faire
  
  New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.

  A "
  
   Netflix Original
  
  " is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.
  

    [12]
   


  In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama
  

    House of Cards
   

  , which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by
  
   David Fincher
  
  , and stars
  
   Kevin Spacey
  
  .
  

    [113]
   

  In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of
  

    Lilyhammer
   

  and a fourth season of the ex-

   Arrested Development
  
  creator
  
   Mitch Hurwitz
  
  and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.
  

    [128]
   

  The
  
   period drama
  


    Marco Polo
   

  premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom
  

    BoJack Horseman
   

  premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.
  

    [129]
   


  The science fiction drama
  

    Sense8
   

  debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by

   J. Michael Straczynski
  


    [130]
   



    Bloodline
   

  and
  

    Narcos
   

  were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015,

  Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The
  
   science fiction
  

   supernatural
  

   drama
  


    Stranger Things
   

  premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama

    Flaked
   

  ,
  

    Netflix Presents: The Characters
   

  ,
  

    The Ranch
   

  , and
  

    Lady Dynamite
   

  . Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.
  

    [12]
   


  The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as
  

    The Ranch
   

  and
  

    Chelsea
   

  , through its Netflix Studios production studios.
  

    [131]
   


  In January 2017, Netflix announced all
  

    Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee
   

  episodes and season 10 would be on their service.
  

    [132]
   

  The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.
  

    [133]
   


  Netflix currently has exclusive "
  
   pay TV
  
  " deals with major and mini-major studios: "Pay TV" deals in essence give Netflix exclusive streaming rights but are not distinct from traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films cataloged in the United States include recent releases from
  
   Relativity Media
  
  – and subsidiary
  
   Rogue Pictures
  
  ,
  

    [134]
   

  as well as

    [136]
   

  which expired in 2016, at which
  
   Showtime
  
  will assume pay television rights,

   Sony Pictures Animation
  
  ,
  

    [141]
   

  and the
  
   Walt Disney Studios
  
  catalog among others.
 

   Epix
  
  signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix in which for the first two years, first-run as well as back catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix (Epix films will come to Netflix 90 days after they premiere on Epix). The exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when
  
   Amazon
  
  signed a deal with Epix to distribute its rights to its
  
   Amazon Video
  
  streaming service.
  

    [142]
   

  These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.
  

    [143]
   



    [144]
   


  On September 1, 2011,
  
   Starz
  
  ceased talks with Netflix to renew its deal. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from the Netflix streaming service on February 28, 2012. Titles that are available on DVD were not affected and can be acquired from Netflix by this method.
  

    [145]
   

  However, select films that have previously been seen on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors. For instance, certain
  
   Revolution Studios
  
  are under license from Lionsgate and
  
   Debmar-Mercury
  
  . Netflix can negotiate to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declines to acquire, such as
  

    The Lorax
   

  ,
  

    ParaNorman
   

  , and
  

    Minions
   

  .
  

    [146]
   


  Netflix's service also holds rights to back-catalog titles to films from among other distributors, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures,
  
   Sony Pictures Entertainment
  
  , 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs under license by
  
   Disney–ABC Television Group
  
  ,
  
   DreamWorks Classics
  
  ,
  
   Kino International
  
  ,
  
   Warner Bros. Television

  ,
  
   Hasbro Studios

   CBS Television Distribution
  
  . The streaming service also held current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by
  
   NBCUniversal Television Distribution
  
  ,
  
   20th Century Fox Television
  
  ,
  
   Sony Pictures Television
  
  , as well as select shows from Warner Bros. Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor
  
   The Criterion Collection
  
  , but were pulled from the streaming library when Criterion titles were added to
  
   Hulu
  
  's library.

  On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC deals
  

    [148]
   

  On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for the first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which are available on Netflix beginning in 2016 – which will assume rights from Starz. However, classics such as
  

    Dumbo
   

  ,
  

    Pocahontas
   

  , and
  

    Alice in Wonderland
   

  will instantly be available.

   Viacom
  
  's expired deal to allow Netflix access to stream programs from
  
   Nickelodeon
  
  and
  
   Nick Jr.
  
  , previously assumed by
  
   Amazon Video
  
  .
  

    [152]
   

  However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, so all of the shows, except some, were removed in March 2015.
  

    [153]
   

  However, most were added to Hulu in May.

  Opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that by 2014, Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch"
  

    [156]
   

  and lost several contracts for streaming movies, to the point where, according to journalist Megan McArdle, "its movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".

  This is a list of devices that are compatible with Netflix streaming services,
  

    [158]
   

  including
  
   Blu-ray Disc
  
  players,
  
   tablet computers
  
  ,
  
   mobile phones
  
  ,
  
   high-definition television

   home theater
  
  systems,
  
   set-top boxes
  
  , and
  
   video game consoles
  
  .
 
  4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting
  
   HDCP
  
  2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft
  
   PlayReady
  
  3.0
  
   digital rights management
  
  solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to
  
   Intel
  

   Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core)
  
  ,
  
   Windows 10
  
  , and running through
  
   Microsoft Edge
  
  web browser.

  Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a
  
   Compete.com
  
  survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.
  

    [180]
   


  During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals.
  

    [181]
   


  In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.
  

    [182]
   


  As of October 2016, Netflix officially supports 18 languages for
  
   user interface
  
  and
  
   customer support
  
  purposes: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Spanish (European and
  
   Standard
  
  ), Swedish and Turkish.
 
  Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad.
  
   Walmart
  
  began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service
  
   Vudu
  
  , in 2010.
  

    [195]
   



   Blockbuster Video
  
  entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a
  
   price war
  
  ; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.
  

    [196]
   

  On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.
  

    [197]
   

  On October 4, 2012,
  
   Dish Network
  
  scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.
  

    [198]
   

  (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)
  

    [199]
   


  In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,
  

    [200]
   

  which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.
  

    [201]
   

  In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).
  

    [202]
   



   Redbox
  
  is another competitor that uses a
  
   kiosk
  
  approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012,
  
   Coinstar
  
  , the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with
  
   Verizon
  
  to launch
  
   Redbox Instant by Verizon
  
  by late 2012.
  

    [203]
   

  In early 2013,
  
   Redbox Instant by Verizon
  
  began a limited beta release of its service,
  

    [204]
   

  which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"
  

    [205]
   

  due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."
  

    [206]
   



   CuriosityStream
  
  , a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".
  

    [207]
   



   Hulu Plus
  
  , like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."
  

    [208]
   


  Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering
  
   pornography
  
  , but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as

  In a 2010
  
   New York Times
  
  interview, Time Warner CEO
  
   Jeffrey Bewkes
  
  downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the
  
   Albanian army
  
  going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."
  

    [218]
   

  Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."

  Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.

  The 16 Netflix nominees were:
  
   House of Cards
  
  with Kevin Spacey,
  
   A Very Murray Christmas
  
  with Bill Murray,
  
   Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
  
  ,

  In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.
  

    [231]
   


  In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.
  

    [232]
   


  At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.

  However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.
  

    [235]
   

  By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.

  Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.

  In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.
  

    [239]
   

  The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to
  

    Forbes
   

  ,
  

    [240]
   

  "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".

  In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.

  Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;

  this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).

  The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just
  
   binge
  
  straight into the next episode.
  

    [245]
   

  Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.
  

    [246]
   


  Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a
  
   pilot episode
  
  in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the
  
   Edinburgh International Television Festival
  
  about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of
  
   House of Cards
  
  , "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300–$400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for
  
   House of Cards
  
  extremely cost effective.
  

    [247]
   

  Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
 
  The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.
  

    [248]
   

  Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and
  
   cable television
  
  programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.
  

    [249]
   


  In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture
  
   Vladimir Medinsky
  
  asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.
