   FaceTime
  
  is a proprietary
  
   videotelephony
  
  product developed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  FaceTime Audio is an audio-only version.
 
  FaceTime is available on supported mobile devices that run on
  
   iOS
  
  and Macintosh computers that run
  

    Mac OS X
   

  10.6.6 onwards. The video version of FaceTime supports any iOS device with a forward-facing camera and any
  
   Macintosh
  
  computer equipped with a
  
   FaceTime Camera
  
  , formerly known as an
  

    iSight
   
   Camera
  
  . FaceTime Audio is available on any
  
   iOS device
  
  that supports
  
   iOS 7
  
  or newer, and any
  
   Macintosh
  
  with a forward-facing camera running
  

    Mac OS X
   

  10.9.2 and later.
 
  Apple CEO
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  announced FaceTime on June 7, 2010, in conjunction with the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  , in a
  
   keynote speech
  
  at the
  
   2010 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  . Support for the fourth generation
  
   iPod Touch
  
  (the first model of iPod Touch equipped with cameras) was announced in conjunction with this device's release on September 8, 2010.
 
  Apple bought the "FaceTime" name from FaceTime Communications, who changed their name to
  
   Actiance
  
  , Inc.

  FaceTime for
  
   Mac OS X
  
  was announced on October 20, 2010 at the "Back to the Mac" Media event on the Apple Campus.
 
  On February 24, 2011, FaceTime left beta and was listed in the
  
   Mac App Store
  
  for
  
   $
  
  0.99. Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the
  
   Sarbanes–Oxley Act
  
  (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring "onerous accounting measures."

  The free beta is still available for download from the Apple servers.
  

    [3]
   

  FaceTime is included for free in OS X from
  

    Mac OS X Lion
   

  (10.7) onwards and iOS.

  On March 2, 2011, FaceTime support was announced for the newly introduced
  
   iPad 2
  
  , which gained forward- and rear-facing cameras.
 

   AT&T
  
  allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were
  
   tiered
  
  , but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans. They were brought before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for
  
   net neutrality
  
  violations.

  On May 2011, it was found that FaceTime would work seamlessly over 3G on all iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch models that supported it. Even though FaceTime worked only over 3G at that time, it now supports 4G LTE calls on networks all over the world, availability being limited to operators' GSM plans.

  FaceTime works by connecting an
  
   iPhone 4
  
  or later, a fourth generation
  
   iPod Touch
  
  or later, an
  
   iPad 2
  
  or later, or a computer with
  
   OS X
  
  , to another supported device. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 introduced high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.
 
  Unlike Mac OS X's
  
   iChat
  
  , FaceTime does not support group conferencing. The application is a one-on-one video chat—only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.
 
  Unlike
  
   Skype
  
  , a multi-person video chatting application, FaceTime specializes in one-to-one video chatting.
 
  In particular, when FaceTiming with someone and you receive messages, emails, or other notifications, when you look at them the FaceTime chat will be paused.
 
  On the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button, or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.
 
  Until the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks (
  
   3G
  
  or
  
   LTE
  
  ) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three
  
   megabytes
  
  of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.
  

    [7]
   

  Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.
 
  FaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service. A single email address can be registered to multiple devices and a call placed to that address rings all devices simultaneously.
 
  On iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac, only persons who have already been added as contacts using the FaceTime or Contacts app can be called because there is no dialer.
 
  The FaceTime protocol is based on numerous open industry standards
  

    [8]
   

  although it is not interoperable with other videotelephony systems:
 
  Upon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an "open industry standard". While the protocols are open standards, Apple's FaceTime service requires a client-side certificate.
  

    [9]
   


  FaceTime calls are protected by end-to-end encryption so that only the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt this data.
  

    [10]
   


  Compared to most
  
   SIP
  
  implementations, Facetime adds techniques that enhance performance at the cost of breaking interoperability:
  

    [11]
   

  port multiplexing,
  
   SDP
  
  minimization and SDP compression.
 
  A new audio-only version of FaceTime, named FaceTime Audio, was announced during the annual
  
   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  (WWDC) keynote speech on June 10, 2013, and released with
  
   iOS 7
  
  on September 18, 2013. As an audio-only version of FaceTime, it effectively makes the protocol into a
  
   voice over Internet Protocol
  
  (VoIP), that competes with other mainstream providers in the field, including
  
   Skype
  
  (
  
   Microsoft
  
  ).
 
  Based on the same
  
   AAC-LD
  
  audio protocol, the service provides high quality audio. The iOS 7 betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi-Fi network (the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime), but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over 3G and LTE data connections, as is the case with most carriers and plans with regard to FaceTime with video. Like the video version, FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices. The feature is not available to run on the
  
   iPod Touch
  
  4th generation as the device does not support iOS 7 or later. FaceTime streaming over cellular data is unavailable for the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  and the
  
   iPad 2
  
  as they only support 3G signals.
  

    [12]
   


  As of October 2016
  

    [update]
   

  , FaceTime is not enabled on devices bought in the
  
   United Arab Emirates
  
  ,
  
   Saudi Arabia
  
  and
  
   Pakistan
  
  ,
  

    [13]
   

  possibly due to regulations in these countries that restrict IP-based communications. In addition, on devices bought in
  
   China
  
  only FaceTime Audio is disabled, while FaceTime Video is available.
  

    [14]
   

  Devices bought outside these countries support both video and audio versions of FaceTime.
  

    [15]
   

  Although
  
   Egypt
  
  ,
  
   Jordan
  
  ,
  
   Qatar
  
  and
  
   Kuwait
  
  originally disabled FaceTime on the iPhone 4, they later re-enabled the feature through a carrier update for existing phone owners and made it pre-enabled on any newly purchased iPhone.
 
  As of April 16, 2014, FaceTime ceased working on earlier versions of iOS which had previously supported it (iOS 4, 5 & 6). This was because the client-side certificate used to authenticate a genuine Apple device with FaceTime servers (amongst other uses
  

    [16]
   

  ) expired on that date. Apple chose not to release an update to this certificate for all devices for which a newer major iOS version (with a new, valid certificate) was available. Apple did release a minor update, to the certificate only, for all
  
   OS X
  
  versions which could run FaceTime, and also for earlier versions of iOS, but only for the small number of devices which could run FaceTime but which could not run a newer major version of iOS. The result of this policy was that almost all iOS users had to update the iOS version on their devices if they wished to continue using FaceTime.
  

    [17]
   

  (This limitation applied even to users of
  
   jailbroken
  
  devices since, even with a legally jailbroken device, it would have been not only difficult but also illegal to extract and install Apple's new certificate, without Apple's permission, in order to work around this issue.
  

    [18]
   

  )
 
  On November 4, 2014, FaceTime scored 5 out of 7 points on the
  
   Electronic Frontier Foundation
  
  's secure messaging scorecard. It lost points because users can't verify contacts' identities and because the code is not open to independent review.
