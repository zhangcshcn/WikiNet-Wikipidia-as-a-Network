   Desktop publishing
  
  (abbreviated
  
   DTP
  
  ) is the creation of documents using
  
   page layout
  
  skills on a
  
   personal computer
  
  primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional
  
   typography
  
  and
  
   printing
  
  . This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for
  
   digital typography
  
  . When used skillfully, desktop publishing allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from
  
   menus
  
  to magazines and books, without the expense of commercial printing.
 
  Desktop publishing combines a
  
   personal computer
  
  and
  
   WYSIWYG
  
  page layout
  
   software
  
  to create
  
   publication
  

   documents
  
  on a computer for either
  
   large scale publishing
  
  or small scale local
  
   multifunction peripheral
  
  output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than
  
   word processing
  
  . However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.
 
  The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for
  
   point of sale displays
  
  ,
  
   promotional items
  
  ,
  
   trade show exhibits
  
  ,
  
   retail package designs
  
  and
  
   outdoor signs
  
  . Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP skills aren't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for
  
   electronic media
  
  . The job descriptions that include "DTP", such as
  
   DTP artist
  
  , often require skills using software for producing
  
   e-books
  
  , web content, and
  
   web pages
  
  , which may involve
  
   web design
  
  or
  
   user interface design
  
  for any
  
   graphical user interface
  
  .
 


  Desktop publishing began in 1983 with a program developed by
  
   James Davise
  
  at a community newspaper in Philadelphia.
  

    [1]
   

  The program Type Processor One ran on a
  
   PC
  
  using a
  
   graphics card
  
  for a
  
   WYSIWYG
  
  display and was offered commercially by Best info in 1984.
  

    [2]
   

  (Desktop
  

    typesetting
   

  with only limited page makeup facilities had arrived in 1978â€“9 with the introduction of
  
   TeX
  
  , and was extended in the early 1980s by
  
   LaTeX
  
  .) The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the
  
   Apple
  

   LaserWriter
  
  printer, and later in July with the introduction of
  
   PageMaker
  
  software from
  
   Aldus
  
  , which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. Later on,
  
   Adobe PageMaker
  
  overtook
  
   Microsoft Word
  
  in professional DTP in 1985. The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to
  
   Aldus Corporation
  
  founder
  
   Paul Brainerd
  
  ,
  

    [3]
   

  who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products, in contrast to the expensive commercial
  
   phototypesetting
  
  equipment of the day.
 
  Before the advent of desktop publishing, the only option available to most people for producing typed documents (as opposed to handwritten documents) was a
  
   typewriter
  
  , which offered only a handful of typefaces (usually fixed-width) and one or two font sizes. Indeed, one popular desktop publishing book was entitled
  
   The Mac is not a typewriter
  
  .
  

    [4]
   

  The ability was revolutionary to create
  
   WYSIWYG
  
  page layouts on screen and then
  
   print
  
  pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300
  
   dpi
  
  resolution for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry. Newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP-based programs from older layout systems such as
  
   Atex
  
  and other programs in the early 1980s. By the standards of the 2010s, early 1980s desktop publishing was a primitive affair. Users of the PageMaker-LaserWriter-Macintosh 512K system endured frequent software crashes,
  

    [5]
   

  cramped display on the Mac's tiny 512 x 342 1-bit
  
   monochrome
  
  screen, the inability to control
  
   letter-spacing
  
  ,
  
   kerning
  
  ,
  

    [6]
   

  and other
  
   typographic features
  
  , and discrepancies between the screen display and printed output. However, it was a revolutionary combination at the time, and was received with considerable acclaim.
 
  Behind-the-scenes technologies developed by
  
   Adobe Systems
  
  set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications. The LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus printers included high quality, scalable Adobe
  
   PostScript
  
  fonts built into their
  
   ROM
  
  memory. The LaserWriter's
  
   PostScript
  
  capability allowed publication designers to proof files on a local printer, then print the same file at DTP
  
   service bureaus
  
  using
  
   optical resolution
  
  600+ ppi PostScript printers such as those from
  
   Linotronic
  
  . Later, the
  
   Macintosh II
  
  was released which was much more suitable for desktop publishing because of its greater expandability, support for large color
  
   multi-monitor
  
  displays, and its
  
   SCSI
  
  storage interface which allowed fast high-capacity hard drives to be attached to the system. Macintosh-based systems continued to dominate the market into 1986, when the
  
   GEM
  
  -based
  
   Ventura Publisher
  
  was introduced for
  
   MS-DOS
  
  computers. PageMaker's pasteboard metaphor closely simulated the process of creating layouts manually, but Ventura Publisher automated the layout process through its use of tags and
  
   style sheets
  
  and automatically generated indices and other body matter. This made it suitable for manuals and other long-format documents.
 
  Desktop publishing moved into the home market in 1986 with
  
   Professional Page
  
  for the
  
   Amiga
  
  ,
  
   Publishing Partner
  
  (now PageStream) for the
  
   Atari ST
  
  , GST's
  
   Timeworks Publisher
  
  on the PC and Atari ST, and
  
   Calamus
  
  for the
  
   Atari TT030
  
  . Software was published even for 8-bit computers like the
  
   Apple II
  
  and
  
   Commodore 64
  
  : Home Publisher,
  
   The Newsroom
  
  , and
  
   geoPublish
  
  . During its early years, desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly organized, unprofessional-looking "
  
   ransom note effect
  
  " layouts; similar criticism was leveled again against early
  
   World Wide Web
  
  publishers a decade later. However, some desktop publishers who mastered the programs were able to realize truly professional results. Desktop publishing skills were considered of primary importance in career advancement in the 1980s, but increased accessibility to more user-friendly DTP software has made DTP a secondary skill to
  
   art direction
  
  ,
  
   graphic design
  
  ,
  
   multimedia
  
  development,
  
   marketing communications
  
  , and
  
   administrative careers
  
  . DTP skill levels range from what may be learned in a few hours (e.g., learning how to put clip art in a word processor) to what requires a college education. The discipline of DTP skills range from technical skills such as
  
   prepress
  
  production and programming to creative skills such as
  
   communication design
  
  and
  
   graphic image development
  
  .
 
  There are two types of pages in desktop publishing,
  
   electronic pages
  
  and virtual paper pages to be printed on
  
   physical paper pages
  
  . All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by
  
   computer memory
  
  or
  
   computer data storage
  
  space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be
  
   printed
  
  , and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with
  
   international standard physical paper sizes
  
  such as "A4, " "letter, " etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in
  
   posters
  
  ,
  
   billboards
  
  and
  
   trade show displays
  
  . A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in
  
   WYSIWYG
  
  format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a printable area if
  
   bleed printing
  
  is not possible as is the case with most
  
   desktop printers
  
  . A
  
   web page
  
  is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the
  
   content
  
  to scale in size with the page or causing the
  
   content to re-flow
  
  .
 
  Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering.
  
   Cascading Style Sheets
  
  can provide the same global formatting functions for web pages that master pages provide for virtual paper pages.
  
   Page layout
  
  is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include
  
   text
  
  , linked
  
   images
  
  that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are
  
   rendered
  
  in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be
  
   keyed
  
  into the layout, placed, or (with
  
   database publishing
  
  applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.
  
   Graphic design
  
  styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements.
  
   Typography
  
  styles may be applied to text automatically with
  
   style sheets
  
  . Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called "wraparound" or "runaround. "
 
  While desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring the line between
  
   word processing
  
  and desktop publishing. In the early days of
  
   graphical user interfaces
  
  in the early 1980s, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time. Programs such as
  
   WordPerfect
  
  and
  
   WordStar
  
  were still mainly text-based and offered little in the way of page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing. On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking, features that are common in many applications today. As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, versatile and user-friendly in the 2010s, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet almost all their publication needs.
 
  In 2010-era usage, DTP does not usually include digital tools such as
  
   TeX
  
  or
  
   troff
  
  , though both can easily be used on a modern desktop system and are standard with many
  
   Unix-like
  
  operating systems and readily available for other systems. The key difference between electronic
  
   typesetting
  
  software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and "What you see [onscreen] is what you get" (
  
   WYSIWYG
  
  ) in design, while other electronic typesetting software, such as
  
   TeX
  
  ,
  
   LaTeX
  
  and other variants, tend to operate in "
  
   batch mode
  
  ", requiring the user to enter the processing program's
  
   markup language
  
  (e.g.,
  
   Hyper Text Markup Language
  
  or "HTML") without immediate visualization of the finished product. This kind of "workflow" is less user-friendly than WYSIWYG, but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent, automated layout is important. In the 2010s,
  
   [
   


      when?
     


   ]
  
  interactive front-end components of
  
   TeX
  
  , such as
  
   TeXworks
  
  or
  
   LyX
  
  have produced "what you see is what you mean" (
  
   WYSIWYM
  
  ) hybrids of DTP and batch processing. These hybrids are focused more on
  
   semantics
  
  than traditional DTP. There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as
  
   Hypermedia
  
  publishing (i.e.
  
   Web design
  
  , Kiosk,
  
   CD-ROM
  
  ). Many graphical
  
   HTML editors
  
  such as
  
   Microsoft FrontPage
  
  and
  
   Adobe Dreamweaver
  
  use a layout engine similar to a DTP program. However, some Web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor, for greater control and ability to "fine-tune" the appearance and functionality. Another reason that some Web designers write in HTML is that WYSIWYG editors often result in excessive lines of code, leading to "
  
   code bloat
  
  " that can make the pages hard to
  
   troubleshoot
  
  .
 
  Desktop publishing produces primarily static print or
  
   electronic media
  
  , the focus of this article. Similar skills, processes, and terminology are used in
  
   web design
  
  . Digital typography is the specialization of
  
   typography
  
  for desktop publishing.
  
   Web typography
  
  addresses typography and the use of fonts on the
  
   World Wide Web
  
  .
  
   Desktop style sheets
  
  apply formatting for print, web
  
   Cascading Style Sheets
  
  (CSS) provide format control for web display. Web
  
   HTML font families

  font usage to the
  
   fonts
  
  available on the user
  
   web browser

  The design industry standard is
  
   Encapsulated Postscript
  
  . Adobe InDesign proprietary format is also common among graphic design professionals. Microsoft Publisher format is common for home users.
