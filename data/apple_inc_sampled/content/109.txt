  The
  
   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
  
  (
  
   WWDC
  
  ), is a
  
   conference
  
  held annually in
  
   California
  
  by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  The conference is used by Apple to showcase its new software and technologies for
  
   software developers
  
  . Attendees can participate in hands-on labs with Apple engineers, and in-depth sessions covering a wide variety of topics. WWDC began in 1983 in
  
   Monterey
  
  , California. Until 2007, the number of attendees varied between 2,000 and 4,200; however, during WWDC 2007,
  
   Steve Jobs
  
  noted that there were more than 5,000 attendees. The WWDC events held from 2008 to 2015 were capped, and sold out at 5,000 attendees (5,200 including special attendees).
 


  Since 1998, the conference has generally started with a
  
   keynote
  
  presentation. It was usually delivered by Jobs, resulting in their becoming termed
  

    Stevenotes
   

  .

  After Jobs' 2011 resignation and death, his successor
  
   Tim Cook
  
  delivered the keynotes.
 
  In 1989, announcing
  
   System 7
  
  .
 
  In 1991, first public demonstration of
  
   QuickTime
  
  .
 
  In 1995, WWDC'95 focused almost fully on the
  

    Copland
   

  project,
  

    [1]
   

  which by this time was able to be demonstrated to some degree.
  
   Gil Amelio
  
  stated that the system was on-schedule to ship in beta form in later summer with an initial commercial release in the very late fall. However, very few
  
   live
  
  demos were offered, and no beta of the operating system was offered.
 
  In 1996, WWDC'96's primary emphasis was a new software component technology called
  

    OpenDoc
   

  ,
  

    [2]
   

  which allowed end users to compile an application from components offering features they desired most. The OpenDoc consortium included Adobe, Lotus, others, and Apple. Apple touted OpenDoc as the future foundation for application structure under Mac OS. As proof of concept, Apple demonstrated a new end-user product called
  
   Cyberdog
  
  , a comprehensive Internet application component suite offering users an integrated browser, email, FTP, telnet, finger and other services built fully of user-exchangeable OpenDoc components.
  
   ClarisWorks
  
  (later renamed
  

    AppleWorks
   

  ), a principal product in Apple's wholly owned subsidiary
  

    Claris
   
   Corporation
  
  , was demonstrated as an example of a pre-OpenDoc component architecture application modified to be able to contain functional OpenDoc
  

    components
   

  .
 
  In 1997, WWDC'97 was the first show after the purchase of
  
   NeXT
  
  , and focused on the efforts to use
  
   OpenStep
  
  as the foundation of the next Mac OS. The plan at that time was to introduce a new system then named
  

    Rhapsody
   

  , which would consist of a version of OpenStep modified with a more Mac-like
  
   look and feel
  
  , the
  

    Yellow Box
   

  , along with a
  

    Blue Box
   

  that allowed extant Mac applications to run under OS emulation. The show focused mainly on the work in progress, including a short history of development efforts since the two development teams had been merged on February 4. Several new additions to the system were also demonstrated, including tabbed and outline views, and a new object-based graphics layer (NSBezier).
 
  In 1998, in response to developer comments about the new operating system, the
  
   big announcement
  
  at WWDC'98 was the introduction of
  

    Carbon
   

  , effectively a version of the
  
   classic Mac OS
  
  API implemented on
  
   OpenStep
  
  . Under the original Rhapsody plans, classic applications would run in sandboxed installation of the classic Mac OS, (called the Blue Box) and have no access to the new Mac OS X features. To receive new features, such as protected memory and preemptive multitasking, developers had to rewrite applications using the Yellow Box API. Developer complaints about the major porting effort to what was then a shrinking market and warnings that they might simply abandon the platform, led Apple to reconsider the original plan. Carbon addressed the problem by dramatically reducing the effort needed, while exposing some of the new functions of the underlying OS. Another major introduction at WWDC'98 was the
  
   Quartz
  
  imaging model, which replaced
  
   Display PostScript
  
  with something akin to
  
   display
   
    PDF
   

  . Although the reasons for this switch remain unclear, Quartz also included better support for the extant
  
   QuickDraw
  
  model from the classic OS, and (as later learned)
  
   Java2D
  
  . Supporting QuickDraw directly in the graphics model also led to a related announcement, that the Blue Box would now be
  
   invisible
  
  , integrated into the extant desktop, instead of a separate window.
 
  In 1999, WWDC'99 was essentially a
  
   progress report
  
  as the plans outlined in WWDC'98 came to fruition. Three major announcements were the
  
   opening
  
  of the operating system underlying the new OS as
  

    Darwin
   

  , improvements to the
  
   Macintosh Finder
  
  , and the replacement of
  
   QuickDraw 3D
  
  with
  
   OpenGL
  
  as the primary 3D API. The system formerly named
  
   OpenStep
  
  , and during development termed
  
   Yellow Box
  
  , was formally renamed
  
   Cocoa
  
  . 2,563 developers attended.
 
  WWDC 2000 was another "progress report" before the upcoming release of
  
   Mac OS X
  
  . Recent changes included a modified dock and improved versions of the developer tools.
  
   Developer Preview 4
  
  was released at the show, with the commercial release pushed back to January 2001. Also,
  
   WebObjects
  
  was dropped in price to a flat fee of US$699. Approximately 3,600 developers attended and the band
  
   The Rippingtons
  
  played at the Apple campus.
 
  In 2001, Mac OS X had only recently been released, but WWDC'01 added the first release of Mac OS X Server and WebObjects 5. Over 4,000 developers attended, and leather jackets with a large blue "X" embroidered on the back were distributed to attendees.
 
  In 2002, Mac OS X v.10.2, QuickTime 6 and Rendezvous (now named
  
   Bonjour
  
  ) were presented.
  

    [3]
   

  Apple also said farewell to Mac OS 9 with a mock funeral, and told the developers that no more Mac OS 9 development would occur, reinforcing that the future of the Mac was now entirely on Mac OS X.

  In 2003, WWDC 2003 demonstrated the
  
   Power Mac G5
  
  , previewed
  
   Mac OS X Panther
  
  (10.3), announced the launch of
  
   Safari
  
  1.0 (concluding its beta phase), and introduced the
  
   iApps
  
  :
  
   iPhoto
  
  ,
  
   iMovie
  
  ,
  
   iDVD
  
  , etc. Attendees received Apple's first model of the
  
   iSight
  
  web camera (to coincide with the launch of iChat AV), pre-releases of Mac OS X 10.3 and Mac OS X 10.3 Server, the O'Reilly book
  
   Cocoa in a Nutshell
  
  , and a 17-inch notebook carry bag. Apple also screened the Pixar film
  

    Finding Nemo
   

  for attendees, ahead of its premiere in cinemas. Originally scheduled for May 19 to 23 in
  
   San Jose, California
  
  , WWDC 2003 was rescheduled for June 23 to 27 at San Francisco's Moscone Center. Approximately 3,000 developers attended.
 
  In 2004, WWDC was held from June 28 to July 2. Jobs noted that 3,500 developers attended, a 17% increase from 2003. New displays were introduced in 23- and 30-inch widescreen.
  
   Mac OS X Tiger
  
  (10.4) was previewed and iTunes 4.9, the first version with integrated podcast support, was demoed by Jobs. All attendees received a developer preview of Tiger, a grey T-shirt with the Apple logo on the front and "WWDC 2004" on the back, a backpack able to hold a 17-inch PowerBook, and a copy of Apple Remote Desktop 2.0. The band
  
   Jimmy Eat World
  
  played at the Apple campus after attendees were taken there by bus from Moscone Center West.
 
  WWDC 2005 was held from June 6 to 10. After a basic market update, Jobs announced that Apple would transition the Macintosh platform to
  
   Intel
  

   x86
  
  processors. The keynote featured developers from
  
   Wolfram Research
  
  , who discussed their experience porting
  
   Mathematica
  
  to Mac OS X on the Intel platform. The conference consisted of 110 lab sessions and 95 presentation sessions, while more than 500 Apple engineers were on site alongside 3,800 attendees from 45 countries. The band
  
   The Wallflowers
  
  played at the Apple campus.
 
  In 2006, Jobs once again delivered the keynote presentation at the WWDC, which was held from August 7 to 11 in
  
   Moscone Center
  
  West, San Francisco. The
  
   Mac Pro
  
  was announced as a replacement to the
  
   Power Mac G5
  
  , which was Apple's prior
  
   pro
  
  desktop computer and the last remaining
  
   PowerPC
  
  -based Mac. The standard Mac Pro featured two 2.66 GHz dual core Xeon (Woodcrest) processors, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, and a 256 MB video card. An Xserve update, based on the dual core Xeons, was also announced. Redundant power and Lights Out Management were further product improvements to Apple's server lineup. While certain key Mac OS X improvements were undisclosed, there were 10 improvements in the next iteration,
  
   Mac OS X Leopard
  
  (10.5), including: full 64-bit app support,
  
   Time Machine
  
  ,
  
   Boot Camp
  
  ,
  
   Front Row
  
  ,
  
   Photo Booth
  
  , Spaces (Virtual Desktops),
  
   Spotlight
  
  enhancements,
  
   Core Animation
  
  , Universal Access enhancements,
  
   Mail
  
  enhancements, and
  
   Dashboard
  
  enhancements (including
  
   Dashcode
  
  , and
  
   iChat
  
  enhancements). Along with the Leopard features that were announced, a major revision to the Mac OS X Server product was announced. New features to the Server included: a simplified set-up process,
  
   iCal Server
  
  (based on the
  
   CalDAV
  
  standard),
  
   Apple Teams
  
  (a set of web-based collaborative services), Spotlight Server, and Podcast Producer. The 2006 WWDC attracted 4,200 developers from 48 countries, while there were 140 sessions and 100 hands-on labs for developers. More than 1,000 Apple engineers were present at the event, and the DJ
  

    BT
   

  performed at the Apple Campus in Cupertino.
 
  WWDC 2007 was held from June 11 to 15 in Moscone Center West, and started with a keynote presentation from Jobs. Apple presented a feature-complete beta of
  
   Mac OS X Leopard
  
  , even though its release date was pushed back to October. Jobs announced that a version of
  
   Safari
  
  , Apple's proprietary
  
   web browser
  
  , had been created for
  
   Windows
  
  , and that a beta release was being made available online that same day. Apple also announced support for third-party development of the then-upcoming
  
   iPhone
  
  via online web applications running in Safari on the handset. The announcement implied that Apple, at least for the time being, had no plans to release an iPhone
  
   software development kit
  
  (SDK), meaning that developers must use
  
   standard web protocols
  
  . Also, Jobs noted during the keynote that more than 5,000 attendees were present at WWDC 2007, breaking the prior year's record. The band
  
   Ozomatli
  
  played at the
  
   Yerba Buena Gardens
  
  .
 
  In 2008, WWDC 2008 took place from June 9 to 13 in Moscone Center West. Apple reported that, for the first time, the conference had sold out. There were three tracks for developers, iPhone, Mac, and IT. Announcements at the keynote included the
  
   App Store
  
  for iPhone and
  
   iPod Touch
  
  , the stable version of the
  
   iPhone SDK
  
  , a subsidized
  
   3G
  
  version of the iPhone for Worldwide markets,
  

    [5]
   


   version 2.0
  
  of
  
   iPhone OS
  
  ,
  
   Mac OS X Snow Leopard
  
  (10.6),
  

    [6]
   

  and the replacement/rebranding of .Mac as
  
   MobileMe
  
  .
  

    [7]
   

  For the bash held June 12, the band
  
   Barenaked Ladies
  
  played at the Yerba Buena Gardens.
 
  In 2009, WWDC 2009 took place from June 8 to 12 in Moscone Center West, and Apple reported that the 2009 conference sold out in late April. Announcements at the keynote included the release of the
  
   iPhone OS 3.0
  
  software announced to developers in March, a demonstration of
  
   Mac OS X Snow Leopard
  
  (10.6), the new 13"
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  , updates to the 15" and 17" MacBook Pros, and the new
  
   iPhone 3GS
  
  .
  
   Phil Schiller
  
  , Apple's
  
   SVP
  
  for Product Marketing, presented the WWDC keynote this year, instead of Jobs, who had taken medical leave of absence since the start of the year.
  

    [8]
   

  Attendees received a
  
   neoprene
  
  messenger bag and the band
  
   Cake
  
  played at the Yerba Buena Gardens. This was the first year plastic badges were used instead of printed paper badges.
 



  In 2010, WWDC 2010 was announced April 28, 2010.
  

    [9]
   

  WWDC 2010 was held at Moscone Center West from June 7 to 11, 2010.
  

    [10]
   

  Apple reported that the conference was sold out within 8 days of tickets being made available, even though tickets were only available at the full price of US$1599 (2009 and prior, tickets could be bought with an early-bird discount of US$300). On June 7, 2010, Jobs announced the
  
   iPhone 4
  
  ,
  

    [11]
   

  and renaming
  
   iPhone OS
  
  to
  

    iOS
   

  . The
  
   FaceTime
  


    [12]
   

  and
  
   iMovie
  

   app
  
  for iPhone
  

    [13]
   

  applications were also announced. The band
  
   OK Go
  
  played at the Yerba Buena Gardens. Attendees received a black track jacket with the letters "WWDC" across the vest and the number "10" stitched on the back.
 
  In 2011, WWDC 2011 was held in Moscone Center West from June 6 to 10, 2011. The event reportedly sold out within just 12 hours of the 5,000 tickets being placed on sale on March 28, 2011.
  

    [14]
   

  The ticket price also remained the same from the 2010 WWDC, selling at US$1,599, however, after-market pricing for tickets ranged from US$2,500 to US$3,500.
  

    [15]
   

  At the keynote, Apple unveiled its next generation software:
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  , the eighth major release of Mac OS X; iOS 5, the next version of Apple's advanced mobile operating system which powers the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch; and iCloud, Apple's upcoming cloud services offering.
  
   Michael Franti and Spearhead
  
  played at the Bash in
  
   Yerba Buena Gardens
  
  on June 9. Attendees received a black track jacket similar to that of the prior year, but with a smaller "WWDC" across the front and the number "11" stitched on the back. This was the final Apple event hosted by Jobs.
 
  WWDC 2012 was held in Moscone Center West from June 11 to 15. The ticket price remained the same as the 2010 WWDC, selling at US$1,599. Apple changed the purchasing process by requiring purchases to be made using an Apple ID associated with a paid Apple developer account. Tickets went on sale shortly after 8:30am Eastern Time on Wednesday April 25, 2012, and were sold out within 1 hour and 43 minutes. In the keynote, Apple announced new models of the MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro including one with
  
   Retina Display
  
  . They also showcased
  
   OS X Mountain Lion
  
  and
  
   iOS 6
  
  .
  

    [16]
   


  In prior years, attendees were required to be at least 18 years old. In 2012, Apple changed this requirement to at least 13 years after a minor who was "accidentally" awarded a student scholarship in 2011 successfully petitioned Tim Cook to retain the award. Despite the change, Beer Bash attendees were still required to be 18 years old, and 21 years old to consume alcohol, in accord with local and federal laws.

   OS X Yosemite
  
  , which features a redesigned interface inspired by iOS. Announcements included the new programming language
  
   Swift
  
  , many developer kits and tools for iOS 8, but no new hardware.
  
   Bastille
  
  performed at the Yerba Buena Gardens, and attendees received a black windbreaker with the letters "WWDC" across the front and the number "14" stitched on the back, along with a US$25 iTunes gift card to commemorate the 25th anniversary of WWDC.
 
  WWDC 2015 was held from June 8 to 12, 2015 in Moscone Center West in San Francisco. The major announcements were the new features of
  
   iOS 9
  
  , the next version of OS X called
  
   OS X El Capitan
  
  , the first major software update to the Apple Watch, the June 30 debut of
  
   Apple Music
  
  , and news that the language Swift is becoming
  
   open-source software
  
  supporting iOS, OS X, and Linux.
  

    [26]
   

  The Beer Bash was held at the Yerba Buena Gardens on June 11.

  WWDC 2016 was held from June 13 to June 17, 2016 at the
  
   Bill Graham Civic Auditorium
  
  and Moscone Center West in San Francisco. The announcements at the event included renaming
  
   OS X
  
  to macOS, the new version named
  
   macOS Sierra
  
  , as well as updates to
  
   iOS 10
  
  ,
  
   watchOS 3
  
  , and
  
   tvOS 10
  
  . Apple proclaimed that the keynote would be the largest ever for developers; this became the reality when they allowed third-party developers to extend the functionality in
  
   Messages
  
  ,
  
   Apple Maps
  
  , and
  
   Siri
  
  .
  
   Cisco Systems
  
  and Apple announced a partnership at the 2016 WWDC.
  

    [28]
   

  Cisco APIs, accessed through
  
   Cisco DevNet
  
  , are to have greater interoperability with Apple iOS and APIs.
 
  The keynote was more about software updates and features, as no new hardware was introduced. New apps that Apple created are the Home App that works with
  
   HomeKit
  
  as a control center for all third-party applications which provide functions for the home. Swift Playgrounds was also announced as an iPad exclusive app that helps younger people learn to code with Apple's new programming language,
  
   Swift
  
  .
