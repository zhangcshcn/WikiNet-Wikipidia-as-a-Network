  The
  
   Xbox 360
  
  is a
  
   home video game console
  
  developed by
  
   Microsoft
  
  . As the successor to the
  
   original Xbox
  
  , it is the second console in the
  
   Xbox series
  
  . The Xbox 360 competed with
  
   Sony
  
  's
  
   PlayStation 3
  
  and
  
   Nintendo
  
  's
  
   Wii
  
  as part of the
  
   seventh generation
  
  of video game consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the
  
   Electronic Entertainment Expo
  
  (E3).
 
  The Xbox 360 features an online service,
  
   Xbox Live
  
  , which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to:
  
   play games online
  
  ; download games (through
  
   Xbox Live Arcade
  
  ) and game demos; purchase and
  
   stream
  
  music, television programs, and films through the
  
   Xbox Music
  
  and
  
   Xbox Video
  
  portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless
  
   controllers
  
  , expanded
  
   hard drive
  
  storage, and the
  
   Kinect
  

   motion sensing
  
  camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.

   Launched
  
  worldwide across 2005–2006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high
  
   failure rate
  
  , indicated by the so-called "
  
   Red Ring of Death
  
  ", necessitating an extension of the device's warranty period. Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console: the
  
   Xbox 360 S
  
  in 2010,
  

    [20]
   

  and the
  
   Xbox 360 E
  
  in 2013.
  

    [21]
   

  As of June 2014, 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide, making it the
  
   sixth-highest-selling video game console in history
  
  , and the highest-selling console made by an American company. Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by
  
   TechRadar
  
  to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live.
  

    [19]
   



    [22]
   


  The Xbox 360's successor, the
  
   Xbox One
  
  , was released on November 22, 2013.
  

    [23]
   

  On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware, although the company will continue to support the platform.
  

    [6]
   


  Known during development as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox,
  

    [24]
   

  the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003.
  

    [25]
   

  In February 2003, planning for the Xenon
  
   software platform
  
  began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President
  
   J Allard
  
  .
  

    [25]
   

  That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in
  
   Bellevue, Washington
  
  to recruit support for the system.
  

    [25]
   

  Also that month,
  
   Peter Moore
  
  , former president of
  
   Sega
  
  of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later.
  

    [26]
   

  Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several
  
   Alpha
  
  development kits were spotted using
  
   Apple's
  

   Power Mac G5
  
  hardware. This was because the system's
  
   PowerPC 970
  
  processor running the same
  
   PowerPC
  
  architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under
  
   IBM
  
  's
  
   Xenon
  
  processor. The cores of the Xenon
  
   processor
  
  were developed using a slightly modified version of the
  
   PlayStation 3
  
  's
  
   Cell Processor
  
  PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the
  
   IBM
  
  employees were "hiding" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the
  
   Cell Processor
  
  .
  

    [27]
   


   Jeff Minter
  
  created the
  
   music visualization
  
  program
  
   Neon
  
  which is included with the Xbox 360.
  

    [28]
   


  The Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005, in the United States and Canada;
  

    [5]
   

  December 2, 2005, in Europe and December 10, 2005, in Japan. It was later launched in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Russia. In its first year on the market, the system launched in 36 countries, more countries than any other console has launched in a single year.
  

    [29]
   


  In 2009,
  
   IGN
  
  named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25.
  

    [30]
   

  Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by
  
   TechRadar
  
  to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing
  
   game achievement awards
  
  .
  

    [19]
   


   PC Magazine
  
  considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it "proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space".
  

    [15]
   

  Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received
  
   Kinect
  
  motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console.
  

    [31]
   



    Edge
   

  ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating "It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...
  

    Killzone
   

  is no
  

    Halo
   

  and nowadays
  

    Gran Turismo
   

  is no
  

    Forza
   

  , but it's not about the exclusives—there's nothing to trump
  
   Naughty Dog
  
  's PS3 output, after all. Rather, it's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox's lifetime. The PC-like architecture meant those early EA Sports titles ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3, Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list, and
  
   Halo
  
  meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive. And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad—another industry benchmark, and a critical one."
  

    [32]
   


  The Xbox 360 began production only 69 days before launch,
  

    [38]
   



    [39]
   

  and Microsoft was not able to supply enough systems to meet initial consumer demand in Europe or North America, selling out completely
  
   upon release
  
  in all regions except in Japan.
  

    [40]
   



    [41]
   



    [42]
   



    [43]
   

  Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site
  
   eBay
  
  during the initial week of release, 10% of the total supply.
  

    [44]
   

  By year's end, Microsoft had shipped 1.5 million units, including 900,000 in North America, 500,000 in Europe, and 100,000 in Japan.
  

    [45]
   


  In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the "first current generation gaming console" to surpass the 10 million figure in the US.
  

    [46]
   

  In the US, the Xbox 360 was the leader in current-generation home console sales until June 2008, when it was surpassed by the Wii.
  

    [47]
   



    [48]
   



    [49]
   

  The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1, 2008.
  

    [50]
   

  Between January 2011 and October 2013, the Xbox 360 was the best-selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months.
  

    [51]
   


  In Europe, the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20, 2008, according to Microsoft.
  

    [52]
   

  In the United Kingdom, the Xbox 360 has sold 3.9 million units as of June 27, 2009, according to
  
   GfK
  

   Chart-Track
  
  .
  

    [34]
   


  While the original
  
   Xbox
  
  sold poorly in Japan, selling just 2 million units while it was on the market (between 2002 and 2005),
  
   [
   


      citation needed
     


   ]
  
  the Xbox 360 sold even more poorly, selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011.
  

    [35]
   



    Edge
   

  magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan, where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely.
  

    [53]
   


  The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals.
  

    [22]
   

  The inexpensive
  
   Nintendo Wii
  
  did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding
  
   Wii U
  
  had a poor debut in 2012.
  

    [19]
   



    [54]
   



    [55]
   



    [56]
   



    [57]
   



    [58]
   

  The
  
   PlayStation 3
  
  struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles,
  

    [59]
   

  making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the
  
   PlayStation 2
  
  , and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360.
  
   TechRadar
  
  proclaimed that "Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One".
  

    [19]
   


  The Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high-profile titles from both first party and third party developers. The 2007
  
   Game Critics Awards
  
  honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform.
  

    [60]
   



    [61]
   

  By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software
  
   attach rate
  
  of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft.
  

    [62]
   

  At the 2008
  
   Game Developers Conference
  
  , Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year.
  

    [63]
   

  As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and
  

    Gears of War
   

  , the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including
  

    Devil May Cry 4
   

  ,
  

    [64]
   



    Ace Combat 6
   

  ,
  

    [65]
   



    Virtua Fighter 5
   

  ,
  

    [66]
   



    Grand Theft Auto IV
   

  ,

    Final Fantasy XIII

    Metal Gear Solid : Rising
   

  ,
  

    [70]
   

  and
  

    L.A. Noire
   

  .
  

    [71]
   

  In addition, Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007, due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3.
  

    [72]
   



   TechRadar
  
  deemed the Xbox 360 as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution, Xbox Live online gaming service, and
  
   game achievement
  
  feature.
  

    [19]
   

  During the console's lifetime, the Xbox brand has grown from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for "living-room computing environment".

   Kinect
  
  motion capture camera was released, which became the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console.
  

    [31]
   


  Microsoft announced the
  
   Xbox One
  
  , successor to the Xbox 360, at
  
   E3
  
  on June 10, 2013. Although succeeded as Microsoft's main console by the Xbox One, support from publishers for the Xbox 360 is expected to continue until at least 2016.
  

    [73]
   

  On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced the end of production of new Xbox 360 hardware; the company will continue to provide hardware and software support for the platform, as selected Xbox 360 titles can be played on Xbox One.
  

    [74]
   


  The main unit of the Xbox 360 itself has slight double concavity in matte white or black. The official color of the white model is Arctic Chill. It features a port on the top when vertical (left side when horizontal) to which a custom-housed
  
   hard disk drive
  
  unit can be attached.
 
  On the Slim and E models, the hard drive bay is on the bottom when vertical (right side when horizontal) and requires the opening of a concealed door to access it. (This does not void the warranty.) The Xbox 360 Slim/E
  
   hard drives
  
  are standard 2.5"
  
   SATA
  
  laptop drives, but have a custom enclosure and firmware so that the Xbox 360 can recognize it.

  Various hard disk drives have been produced, including options at 20, 60, 120, 250, or 320 GB. Inside, the Xbox 360 uses the triple-core
  
   IBM
  
  designed
  
   Xenon
  
  as its CPU, with each core capable of simultaneously processing two
  
   threads
  
  , and can therefore operate on up to six threads at once.

  Kinect is a "controller-free gaming and entertainment experience" for the Xbox 360. It was first announced on June 1, 2009 at the
  
   Electronic Entertainment Expo
  
  , under the codename,
  
   Project Natal
  
  .
  

    [79]
   

  The add-on
  
   peripheral
  
  enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a
  
   game controller
  
  by using gestures,
  
   spoken commands
  
  and presented objects and images. The Kinect accessory is compatible with all Xbox 360 models,
  

    [80]
   

  connecting to new models via a custom connector, and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter.
  

    [81]
   

  During their CES 2010 keynote speech, Robbie Bach and Microsoft CEO
  
   Steve Ballmer
  
  went on to say that Kinect will be released during the holiday period (November–January) and it will work with every 360 console. Its name and release date of 2010-11-04 were officially announced on 2010-06-13, prior to Microsoft's press conference at
  
   E3 2010
  
  .
  

    [82]
   


  Built-in
 
  Through AV connector (excluding E models which have no AV connector)
 
  At launch, the Xbox 360 was available in two configurations: the "Xbox 360" package (unofficially known as the 20 GB Pro or Premium), priced at US$399 or
  
   GB£
  
  279.99, and the "Xbox 360 Core", priced at US$299 and GB£209.99. The original shipment of the Xbox 360 version included a cut-down version of the Media Remote as a promotion. The Elite package was launched later at US$479. The "Xbox 360 Core" was replaced by the "Xbox 360 Arcade" in October 2007
  

    [87]
   

  and a 60 GB version of the Xbox 360 Pro was released on August 1, 2008. The Pro package was discontinued and marked down to US$249 on August 28, 2009 to be sold until stock ran out, while the Elite was also marked down in price to US$299.
  

    [88]
   


  Two major hardware revisions of the Xbox 360 have succeeded the original models; the Xbox 360 S (also referred to as the "Slim") replaced the original "Elite" and "Arcade" models in 2010. The S model carries a smaller, streamlined appearance with an angular case, and utilizes a redesigned motherboard designed to alleviate the hardware and overheating issues experienced by prior models. It also includes a proprietary port for use with the Kinect sensor.
  

    [20]
   



    [89]
   



    [90]
   

  The Xbox 360 E, a further streamlined variation of the 360 S with a two-tone rectangular case inspired by
  
   Xbox One
  
  , was released in 2013. In addition to its revised aesthetics, the Xbox 360 E also has one fewer USB port, no AV connector (and thus is HDMI-only), and no longer supports
  
   S/PDIF

  The Xbox 360 (not Slim and E models) has been subject to a number of technical problems. Since the console's release in 2005, users have reported concerns over its reliability and
  
   failure rate
  
  .
  

    [98]
   



    [99]
   



    [100]
   


  To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a "General Hardware Failure" error report. A "General Hardware Failure" is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red. This error is often known as the "
  
   Red Ring of Death
  
  ".
  

    [101]
   

  In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74
  
   error code
  
  .
  

    [102]
   

  The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes.
 
  Since these problems surfaced, Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability. Modifications include a reduction in the number, size, and placement of components, the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion,
  

    [103]
   

  and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat.
  

    [104]
   

  With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S, the warranty for the newer models does not include the three-year extended coverage for "General Hardware Failures".
  

    [105]
   

  The newer Xbox 360 S and E models indicate system overheating when the console's power button begins to flash red, unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred. The system will then warn the user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled,
  

    [106]
   

  whereas a flashing power button that alternates between green and red is an indication of a "General Hardware Failure" unlike older models where three of the quadrants would light up red.
  

    [107]
   


  The Xbox 360 launched with 14
  
   games
  
  in North America and 13 in Europe. The console's best-selling game for 2005,
  

    Call of Duty 2
   

  , sold over a million copies.

  Five other games sold over a million copies in the console's first year on the market:
  

    Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
   

  ,
  

    [109]
   



    The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
   

  ,
  

    [110]
   



    Dead or Alive 4

    Saints Row
   

  ,
  

    [112]
   

  and
  

    Gears of War
   

  .
  

    [113]
   


   Gears of War
  
  would become the best-selling game on the console with 3 million copies in 2006,
  

    [114]
   

  before being surpassed in 2007 by
  

    Halo 3
   

  with over 8 million copies.
  

    [115]
   


  Six games were initially available in Japan, while eagerly anticipated titles such as
  
   Dead or Alive 4
  
  and
  

    Enchanted Arms
   

  were released in the weeks following the console's launch.
  

    [116]
   

  Games targeted specifically for the region, such as
  

    Chromehounds
   

  ,
  

    Ninety-Nine Nights
   

  , and
  

    Phantasy Star Universe
   

  , were also released in the console's first year.
  

    [117]
   

  Microsoft also had the support of Japanese developer
  
   Mistwalker
  
  , founded by
  

    Final Fantasy
   

  creator
  
   Hironobu Sakaguchi
  
  . Mistwalker's first game,
  

    Blue Dragon
   

  , was released in 2006 and had a limited-edition bundle which sold out quickly with over 10,000 pre-orders.
  

    [118]
   


   Blue Dragon
  
  is one of three Xbox 360 games to surpass 200,000 units in Japan, along with
  

    Tales of Vesperia
   

  and
  

    Star Ocean: The Last Hope
   

  . Mistwalker's second game,
  

    Lost Odyssey
   

  also sold over 100,000 copies.
  

    [119]
   


  The 2007
  
   Game Critics Awards
  
  honored the Xbox 360 platform with 38 Nominations and 11 Wins.
  

    [120]
   

  By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software
  
   attach rate
  
  of 7.5 games per console—a record for any console in history.

  The Xbox 360's original
  
   graphical user interface
  
  was the
  
   Xbox 360 Dashboard
  
  ; a
  
   tabbed interface
  
  that featured five "Blades" (formerly four blades), and was designed by
  
   AKQA
  
  and
  
   Audiobrain
  
  . It could be launched automatically when the console
  
   booted
  
  without a disc in it, or when the disc tray was ejected, but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up, or if inserted when already on. A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad. This simplified version showed the user's gamercard, Xbox Live messages and friends list. It also allowed for personal and music settings, in addition to voice or video chats, or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game.
 
  On November 19, 2008, the Xbox 360's dashboard was changed from the "Blade" interface, to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center, known as the "New Xbox Experience" or NXE.
  

    [122]
   


  Since the console's release, Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software. These updates have included adding new features to the console, enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities, adding compatibility for new accessories, and fixing bugs in the software. Such updates are mandatory for users wishing to use Xbox Live, as access to Xbox Live is disabled until the update is performed.
 
  At E3 2008, at Microsoft's Show, Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the "New Xbox Experience" (NXE). The update was intended to ease console menu navigation. Its GUI uses the Twist UI, previously used in
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  and the
  
   Zune
  
  . Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality (including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection) and the original "Blade" interface (although the color scheme has been changed to match that of the NXE Dashboard).
  

    [123]
   


  The NXE also provides many new features. Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise, but each game's disc must remain in the system in order to run. A new, built-in Community system allows the creation of digitized
  
   Avatars
  
  that can be used for multiple activities, such as sharing photos or playing
  
   Arcade
  
  games like
  

    1 vs. 100
   

  . The update was released on November 19, 2008.
  

    [124]
   


  While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory, the NXE update was the first to require a storage device—at least a 128 MB memory card or a
  
   hard drive
  
  .
  

    [125]
   


  Microsoft released a further update to the Xbox 360 Dashboard starting on December 6, 2011.
  

    [126]
   

  It included a completely new user interface which utilizes Microsoft's
  
   Metro design language
  
  , and added new features such as cloud storage for game saves and profiles, live television,
  
   Bing
  
  voice search,
  

    [127]
   

  access to YouTube videos and better support for Kinect voice commands.
  

    [128]
   


  The Xbox 360 supports videos in
  
   Windows Media Video
  
  (WMV) format (including
  
   high-definition
  
  and
  
   PlaysForSure
  
  videos), as well as
  
   H.264
  
  and
  
   MPEG-4
  
  media. The December 2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of
  
   MPEG-4 ASP
  
  format videos.
  

    [129]
   

  The console can also
  
   display pictures
  
  and perform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects, and supports audio playback, with
  
   music player
  
  controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button. Users may play back their own music while playing games or using the dashboard, and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer.
 
  Music, photos and videos can be played from standard USB
  
   mass storage devices
  
  , Xbox 360 proprietary
  
   storage devices
  
  (such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives), and servers or computers with
  
   Windows Media Center
  
  or
  
   Windows XP
  
  with
  
   Service pack
  
  2 or higher within the local-area network in streaming mode.
  

    [130]
   



    [131]
   

  As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the
  
   UPnP
  
  AV protocol,
  

    [132]
   

  some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the
  
   GeeXboX
  
  project) and
  
   MythTV
  
  can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers. This is possible with video files up to HD-resolution and with several
  
   codecs
  
  (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV) and
  
   container formats
  
  (WMV, MOV, TS).
  

    [133]
   


  As of October 27, 2009,
  

    [134]
   

  UK and Ireland users are also able to access live and on-demand streams of
  
   Sky television
  
  programming.
  

    [135]
   


  At the 2007, 2008, and 2009
  
   Consumer Electronics Shows
  
  , Microsoft had announced that
  
   IPTV
  
  services would soon be made available to use through the Xbox 360. In 2007, Microsoft chairman
  
   Bill Gates
  
  stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was expected to be available to consumers by the holiday season, using the
  
   Microsoft TV IPTV Edition
  
  platform.
  

    [136]
   

  In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices
  
   Robbie Bach
  
  announced a partnership with
  
   BT
  
  in the United Kingdom, in which the
  
   BT Vision
  
  advanced TV service, using the newer
  
   Microsoft Mediaroom
  
  IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year.
  

    [137]
   

  BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity.
  

    [138]
   

  In 2010, while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO
  
   Steve Ballmer
  
  mentioned that AT&T's
  
   U-verse
  
  IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set-top boxes later in the year.
  

    [139]
   

  As of January 2010, IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials.
 
  In 2012, Microsoft released the Live Event Player, allowing for events such as video game shows, beauty pageants, award shows, concerts, news and sporting events to be streamed on the console via Xbox Live. The first live events streamed on Live were the 2012
  
   Revolver
  
  Golden Gods, Microsoft's E3 2012 media briefing and the
  
   Miss Teen USA 2012
  
  beauty pageant.
 
  XNA Community is a feature whereby Xbox 360 owners can receive community-created games, made with Microsoft XNA Game Studio, from the XNA Creators Club. The games are written, published, and distributed through a community managed portal. XNA Community provides a channel for digital videogame delivery over Xbox Live that can be free of royalties, publishers and licenses.
  

    [140]
   



    [141]
   

  XNA game sales, however, did not meet original expectations.
  

    [142]
   

  though
  
   Xbox Live Indie Games
  
  (XBLIG) has had some "hits."
 
  When the Xbox 360 was released, Microsoft's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade, adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver (later renamed Xbox Live Free) to its already established premium subscription-based service (which was renamed Gold). Xbox Live Free is included with all
  
   SKUs
  
  of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on
  
   message boards
  
  , and access Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members.
  

    [143]
   



    [144]
   

  A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as
  

    Viva Piñata
   

  ) or games that feature their own subscription service (e.g.
  
   EA Sports
  
  games) can be played with a Free account. Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision.
  

    [145]
   


  Xbox Live Gold includes the same features as Free and includes integrated
  
   online game
  
  playing capabilities outside of third-party subscriptions. Microsoft has allowed previous Xbox Live subscribers to maintain their profile information,
  
   friends list
  
  , and games history when they make the transition to Xbox Live Gold. To transfer an Xbox Live account to the new system, users need to link a
  
   Windows Live ID
  
  to their gamertag on Xbox.com.
  

    [146]
   

  When users add an Xbox Live enabled profile to their console, they are required to provide the console with their passport account information and the last four digits of their
  
   credit card number
  
  , which is used for verification purposes and billing. An Xbox Live Gold account has an annual cost of US$59.99,
  
   C$
  
  59.99,
  
   NZ$
  
  90.00,
  
   GB£
  
  39.99, or €59.99. As of January 5, 2011, Xbox Live has over 30 million subscribers.
  

    [147]
   


  The Xbox Live Marketplace is a virtual market designed for the console that allows Xbox Live users to download purchased or promotional content. The service offers movie and game trailers,
  
   game demos
  
  , Xbox Live Arcade games and Xbox 360 Dashboard themes as well as add-on game content (items, costumes, levels etc.). These features are available to both Free and Gold members on Xbox Live. A hard drive or memory unit is required to store products purchased from Xbox Live Marketplace.
  

    [148]
   

  In order to download priced content, users are required to purchase
  
   Microsoft Points
  
  for use as
  
   scrip
  
  ;
  

    [149]
   

  though some products (such as trailers and demos) are free to download. Microsoft Points can be obtained through prepaid cards in 1,600 and 4,000-point denominations. Microsoft Points can also be purchased through Xbox Live with a credit card in 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000-point denominations. Users are able to view items available to download on the service through a PC via the
  
   Xbox Live Marketplace
  
  website.
  

    [150]
   

  An estimated seventy percent of Xbox Live users have downloaded items from the Marketplace.
  

    [151]
   


  Xbox Live Arcade is an online service operated by Microsoft that is used to distribute downloadable video games to Xbox and Xbox 360 owners. In addition to classic
  
   arcade games
  
  such as
  

    Ms. Pac-Man
   

  , the service offers some new original games like
  

    Assault Heroes
   

  . The Xbox Live Arcade also features games from other consoles, such as the
  
   PlayStation
  
  game
  

    Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
   

  and
  
   PC games
  
  such as
  

    Zuma
   

  . The service was first launched on November 3, 2004,
  

    [152]
   

  using a DVD to load, and offered games for about US$5 to $15. Items are purchased using Microsoft Points, a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges. On November 22, 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the Xbox 360, in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360's dashboard. The games are generally aimed toward more casual gamers; examples of the more popular titles are
  

    Geometry Wars
   

  ,
  

    Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting
   

  , and
  

    Uno
   

  .
  

    [153]
   

  On March 24, 2010, Microsoft introduced the
  
   Game Room
  
  to Xbox Live. Game Room is a gaming service for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows that lets players compete in classic arcade and console games in a virtual arcade.
  

    [154]
   


  On November 6, 2006, Microsoft announced the Xbox Video Marketplace, an exclusive video store accessible through the console. Launched in the United States on November 22, 2006, the first anniversary of the Xbox 360's launch, the service allows users in the United States to download high-definition and standard-definition television shows and movies onto an Xbox 360 console for viewing. With the exception of short clips, content is not currently available for streaming, and must be downloaded. Movies are also available for rental. They expire in 14 days after download or at the end of the first 24 hours after the movie has begun playing, whichever comes first. Television episodes can be purchased to own, and are transferable to an unlimited number of consoles. Downloaded files use 5.1
  
   surround audio
  
  and are encoded using
  
   VC-1
  
  for video at 720p, with a
  
   bitrate
  
  of 6.8 Mbit/s.
  

    [155]
   

  Television content is offered from MTV,
  
   VH1
  
  ,
  
   Comedy Central
  
  ,
  
   Turner Broadcasting
  
  , and
  
   CBS
  
  ; and movie content is
  
   Warner Bros.
  
  ,
  
   Paramount
  
  , and
  
   Disney
  
  , along with other publishers.
  

    [156]
   


  After the Spring 2007 update, the following
  
   video codecs
  
  are supported:
 
  As a late addition to the December Xbox 360 update, 25 movies were added to the European Xbox 360 video market place on the December 11, 2007 and cost 250 Microsoft points for the SD version on the movie and 380 points for the HD version of the movie.
  

    [157]
   

  Xbox Live members in Canada featured the ability to go on the Xbox Live Marketplace also as of December 11, 2007 with around 30 movies to be downloaded for the same amount of Microsoft Points.
  

    [158]
   


  On May 26, 2009, Microsoft announced the future release of the
  
   Zune HD
  
  (in the fall of 2009), the next addition to the
  
   Zune
  
  product range. This is of an impact on the Xbox Live Video Store as it was also announced that the Zune Video Marketplace and the Xbox Live Video Store will be merged to form the
  
   Zune Marketplace
  
  , which will be arriving on Xbox Live in 7 countries initially, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Spain.
  

    [159]
   

  Further details were released at the Microsoft press conference at
  
   E3 2009
  
  .
  

    [160]
   


  On October 16, 2012, Xbox Video and Xbox Music were released, replacing the Zune Marketplace. Xbox Video is a digital video service on that offers full HD movies and TV series for purchase or rental on Xbox 360, Windows 8,
  
   Windows RT
  
  PCs and
  
   tablets
  
  , and Windows Phones.
  

    [161]
   


  On August 18, 2015, Microsoft rolled out an update renaming it Movies and TV similar to the Windows 10 App.
  

    [162]
   



   Xbox Music
  
  provides 30 million music tracks available for purchase or access through subscription. It was announced at the
  
   Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012
  
  and will integrate with
  
   Windows 8
  
  and
  
   Windows Phone
  
  as well.
  

    [163]
   


  In August 2015 Microsoft rolled out an update renaming it to Groove Music similar to the Windows 10 App.
 
  Xbox SmartGlass is a new feature that allows for integration between the Xbox 360 console and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. An app is available on Android, Windows Phone 8 and iOS. Users of the feature can view additional content to accompany the game they are playing, or the TV shows and movies they are watching. They can also use their mobile device as a remote to control the Xbox 360 console.
 
  PartnerNet, the developers-only alternative
  
   Xbox Live
  
  network used by developers to beta test game content downloads and games developed for
  
   Xbox Live Arcade
  
  ,
  

    [164]
   

  runs on Xbox 360
  
   debug
  
  kits, which are used both by developers and by the gaming press. In a podcast released on February 12, 2007, a developer breached the PartnerNet
  
   non-disclosure agreement
  
  (NDA) by commenting that he had found a playable version of
  

    Alien Hominid
   

  and an unplayable version of
  

    Ikaruga
   

  on PartnerNet. A few video game journalists, misconstruing the breach of the NDA as an invalidation of the NDA, immediately began reporting on other games being tested via PartnerNet, including a remake of
  

    Jetpac
   

  .
  

    [165]
   

  (
  
   Alien Hominid
  
  for the Xbox 360 was released on February 28 of that year, and
  
   Ikaruga
  
  was released over a year later on April 9, 2008.
  
   Jetpac
  
  was released for the Xbox 360 on March 28, 2007 as
  

    Jetpac Refuelled
   

  .) There have also been numerous video and screenshot leaks of game footage on PartnerNet, as well as a complete version of
  

    Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I
   

  , which caused for the whole PartnerNet service to be shut down overnight on April 3, 2010.
  

    [166]
   

  In the following days,
  
   Microsoft
  
  began reminding developers and journalists that they
  
   are
  
  in breach of NDA by sharing information about content available on PartnerNet, and has been asking websites to remove lists of games in development discovered on PartnerNet.
