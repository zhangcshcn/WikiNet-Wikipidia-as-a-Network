   Google Analytics
  
  is a
  
   freemium
  

   web analytics
  
  service offered by
  
   Google
  
  that tracks and reports website traffic.
  

    [1]
   

  Google launched the service in November 2005 after acquiring
  
   Urchin
  
  .
  

    [2]
   

  Google Analytics is now the most widely used web analytics service on the Internet.
  

    [3]
   

  Google Analytics is offered also in two additional versions: the subscription based
  
   Google Analytics 360
  
  ,
  

    [4]
   

  previously
  
   Google Analytics Premium
  
  , targeted at enterprise users and
  
   Google Analytics for Mobile Apps
  
  , an SDK that allows gathering usage data from
  
   iOS
  
  and
  
   Android
  
  Apps.
 


  Integrated with
  
   AdWords
  
  , users can now review online campaigns by tracking landing page quality and
  
   conversions
  
  (goals). Goals might include sales, lead generation, viewing a specific page, or downloading a particular file.
  

    [5]
   


  Google Analytics' approach is to show high-level,
  
   dashboard
  
  -type data for the casual user, and more in-depth data further into the report set. Google Analytics analysis can identify poorly performing pages with techniques such as funnel visualization, where visitors came from (
  
   referrers
  
  ), how long they stayed and their geographical position. It also provides more advanced features, including custom visitor segmentation.

  Google Analytics
  
   e-commerce
  
  reporting can track sales activity and performance. The e-commerce reports shows a site's transactions, revenue, and many other commerce-related metrics.

  On September 29, 2011, Google Analytics launched Real Time analytics.

  A user can have 100 site profiles. Each profile generally corresponds to one
  
   website
  
  . It is limited to sites which have a traffic of fewer than 5 million pageviews per month (roughly 2 pageviews per second) unless the site is linked to an
  
   AdWords
  
  campaign.
  

    [8]
   


  Google Analytics includes
  
   Google Website Optimizer
  
  , rebranded as
  
   Google Analytics Content Experiments
  
  .

  Google acquired Urchin Software Corp. in April 2005.
  

    [2]
   

  Google's service was developed from
  
   Urchin on Demand
  
  . The system also brings ideas from Adaptive Path, whose product, Measure Map, was acquired and used in the redesign of Google Analytics in 2006.
  

    [11]
   

  Google continued to sell the standalone, installable Urchin WebAnalytics Software through a network of
  
   value-added resellers
  
  until discontinuation on March 28, 2012.
  

    [12]
   



    [13]
   


  The Google-branded version was rolled out in November 2005 to anyone who wished to sign up. However, due to extremely high demand for the service, new sign-ups were suspended only a week later. As capacity was added to the system, Google began using a
  
   lottery
  
  -type invitation-code model. Prior to August 2006 Google was sending out batches of invitation codes as server availability permitted; since mid-August 2006 the service has been fully available to all users – whether they use Google for advertising or not.
  

    [14]
   


  The newer version of Google Analytics tracking code is known as the
  
   asynchronous tracking code
  
  ,
  

    [15]
   

  which Google claims is significantly more sensitive and accurate, and is able to track even very short activities on the website. The previous version delayed page loading and so, for performance reasons, it was generally placed just before the
  
   </body>
  
  body close HTML tag. The new code can be placed between the
  
   <head>...</head>
  
  HTML head tags because, once triggered, it runs in parallel with page loading.
  

    [16]
   


  In April 2011 Google announced the availability of a new version of Google Analytics featuring multiple dashboards, more custom report options, and a new interface design.
  

    [17]
   

  This version was later updated with some other features such as real-time analytics and
  
   goal
  
  flow charts.
  

    [18]
   



    [19]
   


  In October 2012 the latest version of Google Analytics was announced, called 'Universal Analytics'.
  

    [20]
   

  The key differences from the previous versions were: cross-platform tracking, flexible tracking code to collect data from any device, and the introduction of custom dimensions and custom metrics
  

    [21]
   


  Google Analytics is implemented with "
  
   page tags
  
  ", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code, which is a snippet of
  
   JavaScript
  
  code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection
  
   server
  
  as part of a request for a
  
   web beacon
  
  .
  

    [22]
   


  The tracking code loads a larger
  
   JavaScript
  
  file from the Google
  
   webserver
  
  and then sets variables with the user's account number. The larger file (currently known as ga.js) is typically 18 KB. The file does not usually have to be loaded, however, due to browser caching. Assuming caching is enabled in the browser, it downloads ga.js only once at the start of the visit. Furthermore, as all websites that implement Google Analytics with the ga.js code use the same master file from Google, a browser that has previously visited any other website running Google Analytics will already have the file cached on their machine.
 
  In addition to transmitting information to a Google server, the tracking code sets a
  
   first party cookie
  
  (If
  
   cookies
  
  are enabled in the browser) on each visitor's computer. This cookie stores anonymous information, called the ClientId.
  

    [23]
   

  Before the launch of Universal Analytics, there were several cookies storing information such as whether the visitor had been to the site before (new or returning visitor), the
  
   timestamp
  
  of the current visit, and the
  
   referrer
  
  site or campaign that directed the visitor to the page (e.g., search engine, keywords, banner, or email).
 
  If the visitor arrived at the site by clicking on a link tagged with
  

  Urchin Traffic Monitor (UTM) codes such as:
 
  then the tag values are passed to the database too.
  

    [24]
   


  In addition, Google Analytics for Mobile Package allows Google Analytics to be applied to mobile websites. The Mobile Package contains server-side tracking codes that use
  
   PHP
  
  ,
  
   JavaServer Pages
  
  ,
  
   ASP.NET
  
  , or
  
   Perl
  
  for its server-side language.
  

    [25]
   


  However, many
  
   ad filtering
  
  programs and extensions (such as Firefox's
  
   Adblock
  
  , and
  
   NoScript
  
  ) and the mobile phone app
  
   Disconnect Mobile
  
  can block the Google Analytics Tracking Code. This prevents some traffic and users from being tracked and leads to holes in the collected data. Also, privacy networks like
  
   Tor
  
  will mask the user's actual location and present inaccurate geographical data. Some users do not have JavaScript-enabled/capable browsers or turn this feature off. However, these limitations are considered small—affecting only a small percentage of visits.
  

    [26]
   


  The largest potential impact on data accuracy comes from users deleting or blocking Google Analytics cookies.
  

    [27]
   

  Without cookies being set, Google Analytics cannot collect data. Any individual web user can block or delete cookies resulting in the data loss of those visits for Google Analytics users. Website owners can encourage users not to disable cookies, for example, by making visitors more comfortable using the site through posting a
  
   privacy policy
  
  .
 
  These limitations affect the majority of
  
   web analytics
  
  tools which use page tags (usually
  
   JavaScript
  
  programs) embedded in web pages to collect visitor data, store it in cookies on the visitor's computer, and transmit it to a remote database by pretending to load a tiny graphic "
  
   beacon
  
  ".

  Another limitation of Google Analytics for large websites is the use of
  
   sampling
  
  in the generation of many of its reports. To reduce the load on their servers and to provide users with a relatively quick response to their query, Google Analytics limits reports to 500,000 randomly sampled sessions at the profile level for its calculations. While
  
   margins of error
  
  are indicated for the visits metric, margins of error are not provided for any other metrics in the Google Analytics reports. For small segments of data, the margin of error can be very large.
  

    [28]
   


  There have been several online discussions about the impact of Google Analytics on site performance.
  

    [29]
   



    [30]
   



    [31]
   

  However, Google introduced asynchronous JavaScript code in December 2009 to reduce the risk of slowing the loading of pages tagged with the ga.js script.
  

    [32]
   



    [33]
   


  Due to its ubiquity, Google Analytics raises some privacy concerns. Whenever someone visits a website that uses Google Analytics, if JavaScript is enabled in the browser, then Google tracks that visit via the users'
  
   IP address
  
  in order to determine the user's approximate geographic location. To meet German legal requirements, Google Analytics can anonymize the IP address.
  

    [34]
   


  Google has also released a browser plugin that turns off data about a page visit being sent to Google.
  

    [35]
   



    [36]
   

  Since this plug-in is produced and distributed by Google itself, it has met much discussion and criticism. Furthermore, the realisation of Google scripts tracking user behaviours has spawned the production of multiple, often open-source, browser plug-ins to reject tracking cookies.
  

    [37]
   

  These plug-ins offer the user a choice, whether to allow Google Analytics (for example) to track his/her activities. However, partially because of new European
  
   privacy laws
  
  , most modern browsers allow users to reject tracking cookies, though
  
   Flash cookies
  
  can be a separate problem again.

  It has been anecdotally reported that behind proxy servers and multiple firewalls that errors can occur changing time stamps and registering invalid searches.
  

    [38]
   


  Webmasters who seek to mitigate Google Analytics specific privacy issues can employ a number of
  
   alternatives having their backends hosted on their own machines
  
  . Until its discontinuation, an example of such a product was
  
   Urchin WebAnalytics Software
  
  from Google itself.

  Google Analytics is the most widely used website statistics service,
  

    [3]
   

  currently in use on around 55% of the 10,000 most popular websites.
  

    [50]
   

  Another market share analysis claims that Google Analytics is used at around 49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites (as currently ranked by
  
   Alexa
  
  ).
  

    [51]
   


  In August 2013, Google Analytics was used by 66.2% of the 10,000 most popular websites ordered by popularity, as reported by
  
   BuiltWith
  
  .
  

    [52]
   

  And in May 2008,
  
   Pingdom
  
  released a survey stating that 161 of the 500 (32%) biggest sites globally according to their Alexa rank were using Google Analytics.
