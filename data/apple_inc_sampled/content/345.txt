      iPhone 5S
     


   iPhone SE
  
  is a
  
   smartphone
  
  designed and marketed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  as part of the
  
   iPhone series
  
  of devices. It was unveiled on March 21, 2016, at Apple's
  
   Cupertino headquarters
  
  and was released on March 31, 2016. The iPhone SE serves as a successor of the
  

    iPhone 5S
   

  : it maintains a 4-inch screen size and largely identical design to the 5S, but includes selected hardware upgrades from the larger
  
   iPhone 6S
  
  model, including its updated processor, rear camera, and support for
  
   iOS 9
  
  software features, such as
  
   Apple Pay
  
  , always-on
  
   Siri
  
  activation, and Live Photos. The model was re-released with new storage options on March 24, 2017.
 
  The iPhone SE was received positively by critics, who noted its familiar form factor and design, improved hardware over previous 4-inch iPhone models, as well as its overall performance and battery life.
 


  The last major redesign of the iPhone, the 4.7-inch
  
   iPhone 6
  
  and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, resulted in larger screen sizes. However, a significant number of customers preferred the 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and 5S; the 5S was the second-most popular iPhone after the 6, ahead of the 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as having "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general,". The iPhone 5 was described as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time."

  Apple's SVP of marketing
  
   Phil Schiller
  
  stated to
  

    Fortune
   

  that the "SE" in its name stood for "special edition".

  The technology specifications of the iPhone SE are similar to the
  
   iPhone 6S

  The exterior design of the iPhone SE is nearly identical to that of the
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  and the
  
   iPhone 5
  
  , with the exception of
  
   matte
  
  -
  
   chamfered
  
  edges and an inset
  
   stainless steel
  
  rear Apple logo. Like the iPhone 6S, the iPhone SE is available in space gray, silver, gold and rose gold finishes.

  Apple stated that cases designed to fit the 5 and the 5S will also fit an
  
   iPhone SE
  
  , as the three phones have exactly the same dimensions.

  As with the 6S, the iPhone SE incorporates the
  
   Apple A9
  

   system-on-chip
  
  (SoC) with an
  
   M9
  

   motion coprocessor
  
  and supports
  
   near field communication
  
  for
  
   Apple Pay
  
  . It also features a 4-inch
  
   Retina Display
  
  at 326

  .

  On launch, it was released in models with either 16 or
  
   64 GB
  
  of internal storage; on March 21, 2017, Apple announced that these models would be replaced by new 32 and
  
   128 GB
  
  models at the same launch price points, releasing on March 24, 2017.

  It features the same
  
   12 megapixel
  
  , with pixels 1.22µ in size,
  

    [12]
   

  rear-facing camera as the 6S, with the ability to record
  
   720p
  
  at 240
  
   frames per second
  
  ,
  
   1080p
  
  at 120 or 60 fps and
  
   4K
  
  at 30 fps, as well as faster
  
   focus
  
  . Despite the upgraded rear camera, it does not feature the same front-facing camera, instead using a
  
   1.2 megapixel
  
  sensor with f/2.4 aperture, but benefiting from the improved image signal processor in the A9 chip, and support for the software "Retina Flash" feature (which allows the display itself to be used as a flash on the front-facing camera).

  Unlike the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the SE does not include
  
   3D Touch
  
  , nor the updated faster second-generation
  
   Touch ID
  
  sensor from the 6S and 6S Plus,

  Lauren Goode of
  

    The Verge
   

  considered the iPhone SE to be "a much-improved, well-designed, small phone with great battery life" and a "kickass upgrade" for existing owners of the 4S or 5S models, noting the device's familiar form factor, high performance (going as far as considering the screen size itself to be the only hindrance to multitasking and certain apps), and improved battery life. The camera's quality and functionality were also praised, arguing that the iPhone SE was a "completely pocketable and powerful little consumer camera" that outperformed other smartphones in its price range. Giving the device an 8.7 out of 10, Goode argued that "the iPhone SE is not a tiny little engine of innovation. It's today's tech in yesterday's phone body. As with anything, we should be wary of giving too much praise to something that's just doing its job."

    CNET
   

  was similarly positive, arguing that Apple had accomplished the task of adapting the 6S's hardware to three different form factors; the smaller SE, 4.7-inch 6S, and 5.5-inch 6S Plus. The iPhone SE was considered to be a "great choice at the small end, with no compromises", albeit recommending that purchasers avoid the 16 GB model; the iPhone SE was the last iPhone model that offered 16 GB as its lowest storage capacity; this option was phased out on both the
  
   iPhone 7
  
  , and later the SE.
