   Excite
  
  (stylized as
  
   excite
  
  ) is a collection of
  
   web sites
  
  and services, launched in December 1995. Excite is an
  
   online service
  
  offering a variety of content, including an
  
   Internet portal
  
  showing
  
   news
  
  and
  
   weather
  
  etc. (outside United States only), a
  
   metasearch engine
  
  , a
  
   web-based email
  
  ,
  
   instant messaging
  
  ,
  
   stock quotes
  
  , and a customizable user
  
   homepage
  
  . The content is collated from over 100 different sources.

  Excite's portal and services are owned by Excite Networks, but in the United States, Excite is a personal portal, called
  
   My Excite
  
  , which is operated by Mindspark and owned by
  
   IAC Search and Media
  
  .
 
  In the 1990s, Excite was one of the most recognized brands on the
  
   Internet
  
  , before its decline in the early 2000s.
 


  Excite was founded as
  
   Architext
  
  in 1994 by
  
   Graham Spencer
  
  ,
  
   Joe Kraus
  
  , Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried, who were all students at
  
   Stanford University
  
  . In July 1994,
  
   International Data Group
  
  paid them US$80,000 to develop an online service. In January 1995,
  
   Vinod Khosla
  
  (a former Stanford student), a partner at the venture capital firm,
  
   Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers
  
  , arranged a US$250,000 "first round" backing for the project, with US$1.5 million provided over a ten-month period. Soon thereafter, Geoff Yang, of
  
   Institutional Venture Partners
  
  , introduced an additional US$1.5 million in financing and Excite was formally launched in December 1995. In January 1996, George Bell joined Excite as its
  
   Chief Executive Officer
  
  (CEO). Excite also purchased two search engines (
  
   Magellan
  
  and
  
   WebCrawler
  
  ) and signed exclusive distribution agreements with
  
   Netscape
  
  ,
  
   Microsoft
  
  and
  
   Apple
  
  , in addition to other companies. In 1994, Excite hired
  
   Jim Bellows
  
  , then 72, to figure out how to present the content in a journalistic manner. He paid good journalists to write brief reviews of web sites. However, users wanted to get directly to the content and skipped the reviews, so the partnership with Bellows ended in 1998.
 
  On April 4, 1996, Excite went public with an
  
   initial offering
  
  of two million shares. In June 1997,
  
   Intuit
  
  , maker of
  
   Quicken
  
  and
  
   TurboTax
  
  , purchased a 19% stake in Excite and finalized a seven-year partnership deal. On October 16, 1997, Excite purchased Netbot, a
  
   comparison shopping agent
  
  . At the same time Intuit announced the launch of
  
   Excite Business & Investing
  
  . Later that year a deal was finalized with
  
   Ticketmaster
  
  to provide direct online ticketing. On March 31, 1998, Excite reported a net loss of approximately $30.2 million and according to its first quarter report it had only enough available capital to meet obligations through December.

  In December 1998,
  
   Yahoo!
  
  was in negotiations to purchase Excite for $5.5 billion to $6 billion. However, prompted by Kleiner Perkins,
  
   @Home Network
  
  's Chairman and
  
   CEO
  
  , Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite’s chairman and CEO George Bell on December 19, and Excite was subsequently acquired by @Home Network, on January 19, 1999.
 


  According to Justin Rohrlich, writing for Minyanville.com, later in 1999, two graduate students at
  
   Stanford University
  
  ,
  
   Sergey Brin
  
  and
  
   Larry Page
  
  , decided that
  
   Google
  
  , the search engine they had developed, was taking up time they should have been using to study. They went to Bell and offered it to him for $1 million, but Bell rejected the offer, and later threw
  
   Vinod Khosla
  
  , one of Excite's venture capitalists, out of his office after he had negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. Excite's refusal to buy what became a $180 billion company by 2010 was labeled by Rohrlich a "stupid business decision".

  The US$6.7 billion merger of Excite and
  
   @Home Network
  
  in 1999 became one of the largest mergers of two
  
   Internet
  
  companies at the time. @Home's high-speed Internet services and existing portal were combined with Excite's search engine and portal, with a move towards personalized web portal content following the merger.

  The new company was named "Excite@Home" (the
  
   stock symbol
  
  and the company's name in regulatory filing records remained as "At Home Corporation" (ATHM)) and, six months after the merger, Tom Jermoluk stepped down as CEO of Excite@Home. Excite’s George Bell, who was the President of the Excite division of @Home after the merger, became the new CEO of the combined Excite@Home, whilst Jermoluk remained
  
   Chairman
  
  of the Board.
 
  Following the merger, the Excite division purchased iMall, as well as
  
   online greeting card
  
  company, Blue Mountain Arts. Excite also acquired
  
   photo sharing
  
  company
  
   Webshots
  
  . Excite furthermore paid for sponsorship of
  
   Infiniti
  

   Indy car
  
  driver
  
   Eddie Cheever, Jr.
  
  , through the 2000 and 2001 racing seasons. However, the merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations. Online advertising revenue plummeted, while cable network ISP revenue continued to grow. On September 21, 2000, after stock value had dropped 90%, George Bell announced plans to step down as CEO within six months. On April 23, 2001, Excite@Home announced Patti S. Hart, the former CEO of Telocity, would become its third CEO in three years. In the same announcement, George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The company also reported first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the same period the prior year.
 
  On June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced that it had raised $100 million in financing from Promethean Capital Management and
  
   Angelo Gordon & Co.
  
  Part of the deal was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by
  
   NASDAQ
  
  . The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero. By August 20 of that year, Excite@Home had replaced its auditors
  
   Ernst & Young
  
  with
  
   PricewaterhouseCoopers
  
  . This triggered a demand from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt. Furthermore,
  
   Cox Cable
  
  and
  
   Comcast
  
  announced that they would separate from Excite@Home by the first quarter of 2002.
 
  On September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts to
  
   American Greetings
  
  for less than 5% of what it had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, Excite@Home filed for
  
   Chapter 11 bankruptcy
  
  protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
  
   Northern District
  
  of
  
   California
  
  . The company's remaining 1,350 employees were
  
   laid off
  
  over the following months. As part of the agreement, @Home's national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to
  
   AT&T Corporation
  
  . @Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home, charged with the sale of all assets of the former company.
 
  At the end of 2001, the Webshots assets were purchased by the company's founders for $2.4 million in cash from the Bankruptcy Court.
 
  During the collapse of Excite@Home,
  
   iWon.com
  
  , an Irvington, New York–based venture, had surreptitiously commenced the design of a new Excite website; iWon.com planned to acquire the Excite.com
  
   domain name
  
  and brand in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. IWon.com eventually made a joint bid with Seattle's
  
   InfoSpace
  
  to purchase the domain name and brand. On November 28, 2001, the court accepted the bid and gave iWon less than three weeks to launch a new Excite portal. Bill Daugherty, iWon's founder and co-chief executive at the time, told
  

    The New York Times
   

  , "I feel like a guy who lived through a hurricane, got pounded and pounded and managed to survive when everyone else was destroyed. Suddenly you walk outside and because of the storm you have beachfront property. That's what Excite is to us."
 
  On December 16, 2001, iWon launched the new Excite portal and transferred millions of Excite users to its new home. iWon changed its corporate name to
  
   Excite Network
  
  , and continued to operate Excite, iWon, and a third portal, MyWay. Outside of the United States, Excite Italia took control of portals in
  
   UK
  
  , Germany, Spain, France, Italy,
  
   Netherlands
  
  ,
  
   Poland
  
  , Switzerland, and Austria. Infospace, for its part, owned and operated the web search function on Excite. This proved to be a short-sighted arrangement as searching became big business on the Internet in the ensuing years.
 
  Excite continued to operate until the Excite Network was acquired by Ask Jeeves (now
  
   Ask.com
  
  ) in March 2004. Ask Jeeves promised to rejuvenate iWon and Excite, but did not. Ask Jeeves management became distracted, according to the
  
   East Bay Business Times
  
  , first by a search feature arms race with
  
   Google
  
  and Yahoo!, and then by its merger with
  
   Barry Diller
  
  's
  
   IAC/InterActiveCorp
  
  , announced in March 2005. "Hopefully, as we start to invest more and get the staff in place and some of the changes to the portal properties that we want, we hope to see (revenue) grow back in the latter half of the year," said Ask Jeeves CEO Steve Berkowitz during a conference call with analysts on April 27, 2005.

  On May 20, 2005, Ask Jeeves made two announcements regarding the rejuvenation of the Excite brand. It first announced that it had acquired Excite Italia B.V. (the operator of Excite Europe), from
  
   Tiscali
  
  , S.p.A.; and, secondly, the company reported that it had reached a comprehensive settlement with InfoSpace regarding Excite in the United States, whereby Ask Jeeves and InfoSpace would share marketing costs and revenue from the Excite web search function. Regarding the acquisition, Ask Jeeves CEO, Steve Berkowitz, said, "We look forward to working with InfoSpace to enhance the search experience on Excite, now that our interests are aligned." On October 17, 2007,
  
   GOADV
  
  , a media company specializing in the generation of Internet "traffic", announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Excite group of companies.

  In a bid to compete against Internet Service Providers like
  
   NetZero
  
  and
  
   Juno Online
  
  , which offered free or low-cost
  
   dial-up
  
  access in the United States, Excite started offering its own "no-pay" service for private customers by partnering with 1stUp.com to create FreeLane by Excite: 1stUp would allow Excite customers to
  
   download
  
  software in order for them to be able log-on to the Internet. The software would then rotate a series of sponsored banner advertisements on the user's computer while they surfed the Internet. 1stUp.com soon went out of business, and Excite switched to another partner named
  
   WorldShare
  
  , rebranding FreeLane as FreeLane version 2.0. As of March 1, 2001 FreeLane was discontinued.

  portal is essentially a ticket selling website where users can buy tickets and search through thousands of events and venues. The powerful search engine capabilities of the Excite server are utilized on this website to help the user search for tickets and events.
 
  Recently Excite.com has also started an education portal that can be used by people to search for and apply for different degrees and online courses. The Excite Education
  

    [8]
   

  portal features a list of thousands of educational institutes across America for prospective students to browse through and apply at.
