  The
  
   MacBook
  
  is a
  
   brand
  
  of
  
   notebook computers
  
  manufactured by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  from May 2006 to February 2012, and relaunched in 2015. It replaced the
  
   iBook
  
  series and 12-inch
  
   PowerBook
  
  series of notebooks as a part of the Apple-Intel transition from PowerPC. Positioned as the low end of the
  
   MacBook family
  
  , below the premium ultra-portable
  
   MacBook Air
  
  and the powerful
  
   MacBook Pro
  
  ,

  the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.
  

    [2]
   

  It was the best-selling
  
   Macintosh
  
  ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.
  

    [3]
   

  Collectively, the MacBook brand is the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."
  

    [4]
   


  There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of
  
   polycarbonate
  
  and
  
   fiberglass
  
  casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody
  
   aluminum
  
  casing, but omitted FireWire. A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate unibody casing.
 
  On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchase as it had been effectively superseded by the MacBook Air whose starting price was lowered.
  

    [5]
   

  Apple continued to sell the MacBook to educational institutions until February 2012.

  A new, redesigned
  
   MacBook line
  
  was launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional
  
   MagSafe
  
  charging port (along with all other ports, except the headphone jack) in favor of the multi-purpose
  
   USB Type-C
  
  port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.
  

    [8]
   




  The original MacBook, available in black or white colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used the
  
   Intel
  

   Core Duo
  
  processor and
  
   945GM
  

   chipset
  
  , with Intel's
  
   GMA 950
  
  integrated graphics on a 667 MHz
  
   front side bus
  
  . Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the
  
   Core 2 Duo
  
  processor and the
  
   GM965
  
  chipset, with Intel's
  
   GMA X3100
  
  integrated graphics on an 800 MHz system bus.
  

    [9]
   

  Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008, after the introduction of the aluminum MacBook.
 
  While thicker than its predecessor – the iBook G4 – the MacBook is wider than the 12-inch model due to its widescreen display. In addition, the MacBook was one of the first (the first being the MacBook Pro) to adopt Apple's
  
   MagSafe
  
  power connector and it replaced the iBook's
  
   mini-VGA
  
  display port with a
  
   mini-DVI
  
  display port. The iBook's discrete graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated
  
   Intel GMA
  
  solution, though the latest revisions of the MacBook were upgraded with the more powerful
  
   Nvidia
  

   GeForce
  
  9400M and later the 320M.
  

    [10]
   


  While the MacBook Pro largely followed the industrial design standard set by the
  
   PowerBook G4
  
  , the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the
  
   iMac
  
  , by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded
  
   numeric keypad
  
  and the Apple logo from the
  
   command keys
  
  .
  

    [11]
   


  A more expensive black model was offered until the introduction of the unibody aluminum MacBook. The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the
  
   iBook G3 (Clamshell)
  
  .
 
  The ports are all on the left edge; on early models, from left to right, they are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, mini-DVI, FireWire 400, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.
 
  For the unibody polycarbonate MacBook (2009), the ports from left to right are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.
 
  On the front, there is a power light and an infrared receiver, while on the right edge, there is only the optical drive.
 
  The polycarbonate Intel MacBook is easier for users to
  
   fix or upgrade
  
  than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access internal components such as the hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.
  

    [12]
   


  In February 2007, the MacBook was recalled because the graphics card and hard drive caused the computer to overheat, forcing the unit to shut down.

  Some early polycarbonate MacBook models suffered from random shutdowns; Apple released a firmware update to resolve them.
  

    [13]
   


  There were also cases reported of discolored or chipping palmrests. In such cases, Apple asked affected owners to contact
  
   AppleCare
  
  .
  

    [14]
   


  There were problems with batteries on some models from 2007 not being read by the MacBook. This is caused by a logic board fault and not a fault with the battery.

  In February 2010, Apple announced a recall for MacBooks bought between 2006–2007 for hard drive issues. This is caused by heat and other problems.

  Apple used the A1181 code, printed on the case, for this family of models, though 17 variations may be counted if color is included.

  On October 14, 2008, Apple announced a MacBook featuring a new
  
   Nvidia
  
  chipset at a
  
   Cupertino, California
  
  press conference with the tagline: "The spotlight turns to notebooks".
  

    [33]
   


  The chipset brought a 1066 MHz system bus, use of
  
   DDR3
  
  system memory, and integrated
  
   Nvidia
  

   GeForce
  
  9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses
  
   LED
  
  backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights used in the previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new
  
   Mini DisplayPort
  
  (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a
  
   multi-touch
  
  glass
  
   trackpad
  
  which also acts as the
  
   mouse button
  
  , and the removal of the
  
   FireWire 400
  
  port (thus it doesn't support
  
   Target Disk Mode
  
  , used for data transfers or operating system repairs without
  
   booting
  
  the system).
  

    [34]
   


  The design had stylistic traits of the MacBook Air which were also implemented into the design of the MacBook Pro. This model is thinner than the original polycarbonate MacBooks, and it made use of a unibody aluminum case with tapered edges. The keyboard of the higher-end model included a backlight.
 
  Although
  
   Gizmodo
  
  concluded it to be "our favorite MacBook to date," they did claim, at this time, its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting.
  

    [35]
   

  Similarly,
  
   AppleInsider
  
  and
  
   Engadget
  
  concluded it "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" and "these are terrific choices—not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display as compared with the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
  

    [36]
   



    [37]
   

  Charlie Sorrel of
  
   Wired News
  
  reached a similar conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook.
  

    [38]
   

  Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for
  
   Macworld
  
  , saying "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker for most of us, anyway."

  On October 20, 2009, Apple released a MacBook that introduced a new polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design,
  

    [45]
   

  faster
  
   DDR3
  
  memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined
  
   audio in/out port
  
  . There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, and the ability to pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases,
  

    [6]
   

  but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.
  

    [7]
   


  Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook follows the same design first seen in the MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than previous laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white
  
   fingerprint-resistant
  
  glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a
  
   multi-touch
  
  glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a
  
   rubberized
  
  non-slip finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced earlier in the year with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by
  
   Macworld
  
  , the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off.
  

    [46]
   

  However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness.
  

    [47]
   


   Gizmodo
  
  also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on.
  

    [48]
   

  The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.
  

    [49]
   


  Despite being hailed by Slashgear as "one of the best entry-level notebooks Apple have produced," the unibody MacBook has received criticism for its lack of a FireWire port and
  
   SD card
  
  slot.
  

    [50]
   

  Nilay Patel of
  
   Engadget
  
  added that the USB ports were easily dented and the bottom of the laptop became worn and discolored after a few days. He also drew particular attention to the fact that the price was not lowered, stating the small price difference between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro makes it a "wasted pricing opportunity."
  

    [51]
   

  However, most critics agree that the unibody MacBook's display is significantly better than its predecessor's.
  
   AppleInsider
  
  states the new display "delivers significantly better color and viewing angle performance" than the previous MacBook, but still "not as vivid and wide-angle viewable as the MacBook Pro screens."

  The rubber bottom of unibody MacBooks have been known to peel off. Apple has noticed this as a flaw and will replace the bottom for free, with or without a warranty. Some consumers have also reported defects in their LCD displays in mid-2010–2011 models.
  

    [58]
   


  The MagSafe power adapter of MacBooks has been known to fray, break, and stop working. Following a lawsuit, Apple replaces these adapters for US residents with affected adapters, purchased (or received as a gift) with computers or as an accessory.
