  The
  
   Apple A7
  
  is a
  
   64-bit
  

   system on a chip
  
  (SoC) designed by
  
   Apple Inc.
  
  It first appeared in the
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  , which was introduced on September 10, 2013. Apple states that it is up to twice as fast and has up to twice the graphics power compared to its predecessor, the
  
   Apple A6
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  While not the first 64-bit
  
   ARM
  
  CPU,
  

    [11]
   

  it is the first to ship in a consumer
  
   smartphone
  
  or
  
   tablet computer
  
  .
  

    [12]
   




  The A7 features an Apple-designed

  64-bit

  1.3

  –1.4
  

    [3]
   

  GHz
  
   ARMv8-A
  


    [4]
   



    [6]
   


   dual-core CPU
  
  ,
  

    [2]
   

  called
  
   Cyclone
  
  .
  

    [4]
   

  The ARMv8-A instruction set doubles the number of
  
   registers
  
  of the A7 compared to the ARMv7 used in A6.
  

    [13]
   

  It has 31 general purpose registers that are each 64-bits wide and 32 floating-point/
  
   NEON
  
  registers that are each 128-bits wide.
  

    [5]
   


  The A7 also integrates a
  
   graphics processing unit
  
  (GPU) which
  
   AnandTech
  
  believes to be a
  
   PowerVR G6430
  
  in a four cluster configuration.
  

    [9]
   


  The A7 has a per-core
  
   L1 cache
  
  of 64
  
   KB
  
  for data and 64 KB for instructions, a L2 cache of 1
  
   MB
  
  shared by both CPU cores,
  

    [4]
   

  and a 4 MB L3 cache that services the entire SoC.
  

    [3]
   


  The A7 includes a new
  
   image processor
  
  , a feature originally introduced in the
  
   A5
  
  , used for functionality related to the camera such as image stabilizing, color correction, and light balance.
  

    [14]
   



    [15]
   

  The A7 also includes an area called the "Secure Enclave" that stores and protects the data from the
  
   Touch ID
  
  fingerprint sensor on the
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  and
  
   iPad mini 3
  
  .
  

    [10]
   

  It has been speculated that the security of the data in the Secure Enclave is enforced by ARM's
  
   TrustZone
  
  /
  
   SecurCore
  
  technology.
  

    [16]
   

  In a change from the
  
   Apple A6
  
  , the A7 SoC no longer services the accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. In order to reduce power consumption, this functionality has been moved to the new
  
   M7
  
  motion
  
   coprocessor
  


    [17]
   



    [18]
   

  which appears to be a separate ARM-based microcontroller from
  
   NXP Semiconductors
  
  .
  

    [1]
   


  Apple uses the APL0698 variant of the A7 chip in the
  
   iPhone 5S
  
  ,
  
   iPad Mini 2
  
  , and
  
   iPad Mini 3
  
  .
  

    [19]
   

  This A7 is manufactured by
  
   Samsung
  
  on a
  
   high-κ
  

   metal gate
  
  (HKMG) 28 nm process
  

    [1]
   



    [20]
   

  and the chip includes over 1 billion transistors on a die 102 mm
  
   2
  
  in size.
  

    [2]
   

  According to ABI Research the A7 drew 1100
  
   mA
  
  during fixed point operations and 520 mA during floating point operations, while its predecessor, the A6 processor in the iPhone 5, drew 485 mA and 320 mA.
  

    [21]
   

  It is manufactured in a
  
   package on package
  
  (PoP) together with 1
  
   GB
  
  of
  
   LPDDR3
  
  DRAM with a 64-bit wide memory interface onto the package.
  

    [4]
   



    [22]
   


  Apple uses the APL5698 variant of the A7 chip in the
  
   iPad Air
  
  . Its die is identical in size and layout to that of the first A7 and is manufactured by Samsung.
  

    [23]
   

  However, unlike the first version of the A7, the A7 used in the iPad Air is not on a PoP, having no stacked RAM. Instead it uses a chip-on-board mounting, immediately adjacent DRAM, and is covered by a metallic heat spreader, similar to the
  
   Apple A5X
  
  and
  
   A6X
  
  .
  

    [23]
   



    [24]
   


  The A7's
  
   branch predictor
  
  has been claimed to infringe on a 1998 patent.
  

    [25]
   

  On October 14, 2015, a district judge found Apple guilty of infringing U.S. patent
  

    US 5781752
   





  , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on the Apple A7 and A8 processors. The patent is owned by
  
   Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation
  
  , a firm affiliated with the
  
   University of Wisconsin
  
  . The company could be liable for up to US$862.4 million in damages.
