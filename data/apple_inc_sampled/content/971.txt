   macOS Server
  
  , formerly
  
   Mac OS X Server
  
  and
  
   OS X Server
  
  , is a separately sold operating system add-on which provides additional server programs along with management and administration tools for
  
   macOS
  
  .
 
  Prior to version
  
   10.7 (Lion)
  
  , Mac OS X Server was a separate but similar
  
   Unix
  


    [3]
   

  server
  
   operating system
  
  from
  
   Apple Inc.
  

   architecturally
  
  identical to its desktop counterpart
  
   Mac OS X
  
  . With the release of version
  
   10.7 (Lion)
  
  , Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server were combined into one release. A separate "server" operating system is no longer sold; the server-specific server applications and work group management and administration software tools from Mac OS X Server are now offered as
  
   macOS Server
  
  , an add-on package for macOS sold through the
  
   Mac App Store
  


    [4]
   

  along with
  
   Workgroup Manager 10.8
  
  , available from the Apple support web site.
  

    [5]
   


  These tools simplify access to key
  
   network services
  
  , including a
  
   mail transfer agent
  
  ,
  
   AFP
  
  and
  
   SMB
  
  servers, an
  
   LDAP
  
  server, a
  
   domain name server
  
  , and others. Also included (particularly in later versions) are numerous additional services and the tools to manage them, such as
  
   web server
  
  ,
  
   wiki
  
  server, chat server, calendar server, and many others.
 


  Mac OS X Server was provided as the operating system for
  
   Xserve
  
  computers,
  
   rack mounted
  

   server computers
  
  designed by Apple. Also, it was optionally
  
   pre-installed
  
  on the
  
   Mac Mini
  
  and
  
   Mac Pro
  
  and was sold separately for use on any
  
   Macintosh
  
  computer meeting its minimum requirements.
 
  macOS Server is based on an
  
   open source
  
  foundation called
  
   Darwin
  
  and uses open industry standards and protocols. It included services and applications for file sharing, sharing contact information and calendars, schedule events, send secure instant messages, conduct live video conferences, send and receive email, contribute to and comment in wikis, publish a company-wide blog, produce and distribute podcasts, and set up websites.
 
  The first version of Mac OS X was
  
   Mac OS X Server 1.0
  
  . Mac OS X Server 1.0 – 1.2v3 were based on
  
   Rhapsody
  
  , a hybrid of
  
   OPENSTEP
  
  from NeXT Computer and
  
   Mac OS 8.5.1
  
  . The
  
   GUI
  
  looked like a mixture of Mac OS 8's Platinum appearance with OPENSTEP's
  
   NeXT
  
  -based interface. It included a runtime layer called Blue Box for running legacy Mac OS-based applications within a separate window. There was discussion of implementing a 'transparent blue box' which would intermix Mac OS applications with those written for Rhapsody's Yellow Box environment, but this would not happen until
  
   Mac OS X
  
  's Classic environment. Apple File Services, Macintosh Manager, QuickTime Streaming Server,
  
   WebObjects
  
  and
  
   NetBoot
  
  were included with Mac OS X Server 1.0 – 1.2v3. It could not use
  
   FireWire
  
  devices.

  In releasing the developer preview of
  
   Mac OS X Lion
  
  in February 2011, Apple indicated that beginning with Lion, Mac OS X Server would be bundled with the operating system and would not be marketed as a separate product.
  

    [10]
   

  However, a few months later, the company said it would instead sell the server components as a
  
   US$
  
  49.99 add-on to Lion, distributed through the
  
   Mac App Store
  
  (as well as Lion itself).
  

    [11]
   

  The combined cost of an upgrade to Lion and the purchase of the OS X Server add-on, which costs approximately US$50,
  

    [7]
   

  was nonetheless significantly lower than the retail cost of Snow Leopard Server (US$499).
 
  Lion Server came with unlimited client licenses as did Snow Leopard Server.
 
  Lion Server includes new versions of
  
   iCal Server
  
  ,
  
   Wiki Server
  
  , and
  
   Mail Server
