            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> is so far the largest public database of knowledge. 
            Usually when searching over wikipedia, the returned page is the very article that exactly matches the query. 
            However, when reading wikipedia articles, people often loss their mind after following a few links 
            (usually in a depth-first pattern). In order to use the powerful online database more efficiently , 
            a technique that provide the most related articles along with the exact page is need. 
            That is what WikiNet is for. </p>
            
            <h3> The Wiki part: Heuristic crawler </h3>

            <p>Because of our limited storage and computation resource, it is not feasible for us to traversd and 
                index the whole wikipedia. As a result, heuristic methods are heavily used. </p>
            
            <p> Wikipedia pages have in- and out-links to other pages. Some links are pointing at a highly related page, 
                while others are not. (i.e. The page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">apple</a> the fruit, 
                has a hyper link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve">Adam and Eve</a>. 
                However, the word of "apple" doesn't even appear on the latter. 
                In fact, it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_(symbolism)">apple</a> the symbol 
                that is closely related to Adams and Eves. ) So when crawling wikipedia pages, 
                we conduct for- and backwards evaluation and only index the highly related pages. 
                We also limit the depth of the BFS crawling to 4. </p>
            
            <p> We crawled pages from 4 different seeds. </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>seed</td> <td># visted pages</td> <td># of indexed pages</td> <td> LOG file </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple"> Apple </a></td>
                    <td> 13956 </td> <td> 6619 </td>
                    <td><a href="/static/Apple.stats"> here </a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc"> Apple Inc. </a></td>
                    <td> 14929 </td> <td> 6050 </td>
                    <td><a href="/static/Apple_Inc.stats"> here </a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"> Artificial intelligence </a></td>
                    <td> 27123 </td> <td> 12682 </td>
                    <td><a href="/static/Aritificial_intelligence.stats"> here </a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University"> New York University </a></td>
                    <td> 17688 </td> <td> 6769 </td>
                    <td><a href="/static/New_York_University.stats"> here </a></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p> We only conduct experiment on the two apples. 
                You may search using the keyword "apple" to find out which one is currently running. </p>
            
            <h3> The Net part: Directed weighted graph </h3>

            <p> Now that Wikipedia is an online database, the system is by nature a complex network, 
                where artibles are the nodes, and hyperlinks the edges. 
                We build a graph from the dataset. 
                We used TF-IDF to index the main content of the pages 
                and marked the weight of the edges using the cosine coefficent between the two pages. 
                We end up with a directed weighted graph. </p> 
                <div style="display: flex; width: 90%; max-width: 500px; 
                margin:5px auto; padding:5px 5px 5px 5px; 
                flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; justify-content: center;" >
                    <img style="padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; width: 90%; max-width: 500px" src="apple.jpg"><br>
                    <p>This is an illustration of the graph corresponding to the dataset starting from 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple"> Apple </a>. Nodes of the same color 
                    fall into the same cluster based on a modularity-based community detection algorithm 
                    (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/">the Louvain method</a>). </p>
                </div>
            
            <p> Finding the most related page or path is similar to the 
                <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem">Longest Simple Path problem</a>, 
                which is NP-hard. Luckily, in our case, the weight of the edges are between 0 and 1. 
                If we compute the weight of a path by multipling the cosine coefficent 
                of consecutive pair of pages on the path, which is a reasonable way, 
                a simple modification to the widely-used all pair shortest path algorithm is sufficient to solve our problem. 
                We therefore define the closeness between a pair of pages with the largest weight of all paths between them. </p>
            
            <h3> A few more words </h3>
            <p>WikiNet is a project, in responce to the Graduate Course of 
                <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-GA.2580-001/">Web Search Engine</a> 
                at New York University Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, 
                seeking to explore wikipedia as a graph of knowledge.
                We implement a search engine for the relations in the graph. 
                So far, we provide two search functions:
            <ol>
                <li> Match your keywords with the most related wikipedia page in our dataset, 
                    then list the top 20 most related pages it derives into 
                    and the top 20 most related pages that can derive into the exact match. </li>
                <li> Take a pair of keywords. Match them with the most related wikipedia page in our dataset respectively. 
                    Then return the most related path bewteen the two pages. </li>
            </ol></p>
